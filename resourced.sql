Instead, it is recommended that you test Beta 2 on a test server and site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test the WordPress 6.0 Beta 2 in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 1: </strong>Install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (select the “Bleeding edge” channel and “Beta/RC Only” stream).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 2: </strong>Direct download the<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.0-beta2.zip\"> beta version here (zip)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 3:</strong> Use WP-CLI to test: <code>wp core update --version=6.0-beta2</code><br><strong><em>Do not use this option if your filesystem is case-insensitive.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current target for the final release is May 24, 2022, which is about five weeks away.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional information on the full <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-0/\">6.0 release cycle is available</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes+6-0/\">6.0-related developer notes</a> in the coming weeks, which will detail all upcoming changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What’s New In Beta 2</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a reminder, contributors have fixed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;resolution=fixed&amp;milestone=6.0&amp;group=component&amp;order=priority\">209 tickets in WordPress 6.0</a>, including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;status=reopened&amp;changetime=04%2F12%2F2022..04%2F19%2F2022&amp;type=enhancement&amp;type=feature+request&amp;milestone=6.0&amp;group=component&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=type&amp;col=status&amp;col=milestone&amp;col=changetime&amp;col=owner&amp;col=priority&amp;col=keywords&amp;order=changetime\">110 new features and enhancements</a>. Each beta cycle focuses on bug fixes, and more are on the way with your help through testing. Here are a few of the changes you will find in Beta 2 specifically:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Block Editor: Prevent styles from being added to the site editor (#<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55567\">55567</a>)</li><li>Patterns REST API: Add &#8216;inserter&#8217; to the schema&nbsp; (#<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55567\">55567</a>)</li><li>Don’t load remote patterns twice in WP_REST_Block_Patterns_Controller::get_items (#<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55567\">55567</a>)</li><li>Add the ability to filter the whole notification email in retrieve_password (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/54690\">#54690</a>)</li><li>Avoid translating empty plugin headers (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/54586\">#54586</a>)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Note on Webfonts API</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week’s announcement for <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/04/wordpress-6-0-beta-1/\">WordPress 6.0 Beta 1</a> includes a reference to “Webfonts API:<strong> </strong>Manage local fonts with PHP or theme.json,” as a feature that would be included in the release. This specific functionality was not included in Beta 2 but may be available at RC.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How to Help</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for issues is critical for stabilizing a release throughout its development. Testing is also a great way to contribute to WordPress. If you are new to testing, check out this <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2022/04/12/help-wanted-test-wordpress-6-0/\">detailed guide</a> that will walk you through how to get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think you have run into an issue, please report it to the<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\"> Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. If you are comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, you can<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/newticket\"> file one on WordPress Trac</a>.

So you&#8217;ve been listening to this podcast for a while. You may be one of these contributors I keep mentioning; you may be an agency owner or freelancer. Maybe you&#8217;ve wondered how to make a WordPress blog for your big idea. Or, maybe you&#8217;re one of the many people who use WordPress for their project or business. Before WordPress was known as a content management system, as a way to get sites online fast, it was a blogging tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have long since outgrown that, but even 19 years into our journey, blogging is still a key part of what WordPress enables you to do. That&#8217;s because even after those 19 years, the mission of WordPress is still the same. And that is to democratize publishing, to help people have a place online where they can tell their stories or share their projects or set up their businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever tried to set up a blog, you know that there isn&#8217;t a lot of information about what to know before you get going at all. So I&#8217;m going to talk about that a little bit today. And just by the way, if you heard the word blog right now and thought, oh, Josepha, how old fashioned? I think it&#8217;s important to remember that there&#8217;s a business advantage to having well-written, relevant content on your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re not blogging for business, because not all of us are, then the benefits are a little different but still important to my mind. Things like the cathartic benefits of journaling, a chance to build community, and the general importance of preserving wisdom for the ages. Anyway, back to the topic at hand. Before we can get to any of the fancy things that WordPress can do nowadays, it&#8217;s important to know a few things as you get ready to set up your first ever website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s dive in. Here is how you need to get yourself started. First, have an idea and a plan. So have an idea for what you&#8217;re doing, the concept of your content, who you want to reach, and some concept of a domain name. I would encourage you to not necessarily get your heart set on a domain name at first. Cause, like, if you want the domain name, wordpress.org, like we own that, you can have that! But if you know that you want a domain like WordPressbloggingforthefuture.com, like that one might be more available. And if you know the kind of words you want in your domain, you can be a bit flexible about what is there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:09]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that you need to do is that if you are just getting started, ask yourself the question, what sort of host do I want? We kind of mentioned all along the WordPress process that, like, you need a good host, but it’s not always clear where that decision has to happen. It happens right here at the start, before you even know what WordPress is most of the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the earliest question that you have to answer for yourself is what sort of host do I want? Where do I want my site to live? So ask yourself how much you want to get into the maintenance and configuration of your website and the hardware that it lives on versus creating content or keeping your shop up to date.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s this whole spectrum of hosting options, and they range from full service where they will keep your WordPress software up to date, provide daily backups, and have customer support if something goes really wrong. So it ranges all the way from full service like that all the way down to essentially zero services, just kind of hands-off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:11]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>They give you a space to keep your WordPress software, to keep your WordPress site. But they leave everything else up to you. They leave the backups up to you. They leave updating up to you, things like. So that&#8217;s the first thing you have to ask yourself. And the first question you have to be able to answer. Most of the time, you will want to start with one of the full-service options. That way, you know that your software is set up correctly and safely from the start. And as you learn more about the software and what you want and what you need, and you have the ability to learn in the time that you have, the more that you can add on either service with the existing hosts that you chose or moving to a different host; however that works out for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if that one sounds like the right option, then you choose a host, go to their site, and actually most of them will have a way to walk you through how to set up a WordPress site inside their system. Most of the time, it&#8217;s just one click and then they ask you some questions to get some configurations right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:10]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other option that on the like zero, zero service side, that&#8217;s not quite fair, but you know, the other side of that spectrum that probably will be appealing to you if you are already familiar with code or already know how to manage a server or, or you know how to work in this thing called c-panel, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you already have a lot of information on how all of that works, you can, if you want to, head over to wordpress.org/download, and you can download a zip file of the WordPress software and set that up in your own environment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, quick check here. If this all sounds roughly doable to you, or at least it feels like we&#8217;re in the right starting point, but you find yourself thinking, gosh, I just wish she would slow down a little.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got you covered. In the show notes, you&#8217;ll find a link to one of the Learn WP courses for getting started with WordPress. There&#8217;s a section on choosing a host as well as various other early steps of this process. So if you felt like I blazed through all of that, which honestly I kind of did, you can work through those lessons in that course, at your own pace, and it&#8217;s, and it&#8217;s really a very good guide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:06:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. Let&#8217;s pretend we did all of that. Now you&#8217;ve got yourself a website. The thing that you will want to do next, or rather the first thing that you&#8217;ll notice once you get your site up and running, is that there&#8217;s this ‘Hello World’ post– there&#8217;s a post that already exists in there. The Hello World post is a placeholder for the common features of a blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There, you can find your featured image, your title, your content, and even some fake comments. You can either edit this post so that you can see how your writing will look from the start, and you can kind of compare like, okay, the Hello World part over here on this page, exists in this field over here on this page. So you can kind of see where everything works, how it all looks together. Or, if you&#8217;re more familiar with WordPress or CMS in general, you can simply remove that and start fresh.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:07:17]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;ve got now a website, we know, kind of, how to look at our posts and create posts, where comments are, where they can kind of be moderated and stuff. And so, the most fun task for everyone is choosing a theme. But if it&#8217;s not a fun task, if it doesn&#8217;t sound like a fun task to you, I can help you kind of do some, choose your own adventure guiding questions here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, you can ask yourself how you want the site to look. Do you want it to mostly be a lot of photos or entirely words, mostly animations? You can head to the theme directory and search for a theme with most of the features that you want. There&#8217;s like a filtering system where you can put in, like, you want three columns so that you can have three columns of text if you want it to look kind of like an old school newspaper kind of layout and things like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:08:12]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also a way to look for themes inside your instance, your WordPress site, but like, if you haven&#8217;t set that up yet, but you do still want to see kind of what your theme options are, you can go to wordpress.org/themes and and take a look at what&#8217;s out there. Just as a quick side note, if you get to that theme directory, if you get to wordpress.org/themes, and it feels overwhelming, which I can understand, I recommend starting with a theme that is designed for blogging specifically so that you can see how things look right away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s actually a theme that does come with every WordPress site. So if you&#8217;re not ready, you can skip this thing entirely and just work with the theme that&#8217;s already there. Every word, press instance ships with a theme and it is fully functional when you, when you get your site up and running. So you don&#8217;t need to choose a theme right now if you don&#8217;t feel ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the other very fun thing that people do with their WordPress sites is to add plugins to them. So plugins are these little pieces of software that you add on to the WordPress software that lets it do additional things. It adds additional functionality. The questions that you can ask to kind of guide yourself through what sorts of plugins you might want, what sorts of functionality you might want to add to your site are a little similar to the ones that you want to ask for figuring out which theme.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:09:36]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So figure out if there are tasks that you need visitors to do. Do you need them to contact you? Do you want them to watch a video? Should they review and respond to questions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a concept of the things that you want users to do on your website, then you can head to the plugin directory and search for a plugin with features that you need. Also, there are just endless lists of recommended plugins out there; if that is something that you find valuable as part of your research, those are also easy to find.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a general side note here, there are even more plugins than there are themes. So if you have gotten to this point and feel like you don&#8217;t quite know the answers to the questions that I shared, and, and it&#8217;s going to be a while until you feel like you can know what those answers are. That&#8217;s totally fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll tell you this. I have never seen a site without a contact form. So feel free to begin your journey there. There are a lot of great plugins for contact forms and it can kind of help you figure out how to work with plugins in that way. So yeah, I made it sound like you can get a WordPress website built in like seven minutes and on the one hand you definitely can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:09:36]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on the other hand, it&#8217;s still a little bit more complicated. So here I have a final note for everyone. You will hear around the WordPress ecosystem. And obviously, here, are some things that could make you feel a little nervous about doing this for the first time. Things like the five-second installation, which WordPress has been famous for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also about how easy and simple it all is. And as somebody who was once in the position of learning WordPress for the first time, like I first encountered a WordPress site in 2009 and I started learning how to use WordPress in 2010. So I can say with confidence that once you learn it, it&#8217;s easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are the easiest of the hard options for CMS. Like content management systems are just complicated, but we are the easiest one out there. And so, as you&#8217;re learning, I want to just remind you to celebrate your small wins along the way. If you feel like you&#8217;re late to this blogging game, like you should have had a website for years. I mean, sure that could be true. And yes, the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. But the second-best time to plant that tree is today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress didn&#8217;t start out powering over 40% of the web, and your first site can&#8217;t be immediately measured in the millions of readers. So, what will your small beginning lead you to?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:12:25]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now that brings us to our small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one, the next release of WordPress, WordPress 6.0, has reached its beta phase. That means the full focus is on finding and fixing the bugs we accidentally created during this development cycle. Beta two comes out tomorrow and you can follow along in the core channel in the Making WordPress Slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve never seen how those releases get packaged, and if you just want to keep an eye on what everybody&#8217;s doing so that you can be the first to know, yeah, Making WordPress Slack is the way to go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on our small list is that speaking of WordPress 6.0, we had the public walk through a couple of weeks ago, which means that in a few weeks, I&#8217;ll do a WordPress 6.0 sneak peek. I&#8217;ll share some highlights of the release features and why I think they are super important for you to take a look. Sooner rather than later.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:13:22]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final, big thing, if you are new to WordPress and this episode has you all fired up to start your blog, we have a bunch of contributors over on the Learn WP team that have just the thing for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can join the online social learning space called How to Make a WordPress Blog. It&#8217;s a free online event that will help you get started. I&#8217;ll link the information in the show notes below. And I&#8217;ll also share in the show notes, a list of WordPress Meetup groups, where you can find more opportunities to learn and get support from other people locally who are also doing things with WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you can also find a list in the dashboard of your newly installed WordPress blog you no doubt have after this podcast.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12658\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20:\"WordPress 6.0 Beta 1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/04/wordpress-6-0-beta-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 19:08:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"6.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12644\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"WordPress 6.0 Beta 1 is now available for download and testing.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Dan Soschin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7809:\"\n<p>WordPress 6.0 Beta 1 is now available for download and testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This version of the WordPress software is under development</strong>.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing: the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:00:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was checking the list of upcoming events recently as part of just my regular work and saw that the call for organizers for WordCamp Asia is open. On the one hand, it made my heart skip a beat with excitement. That event is six years or so in the making. And on the other hand, it reminded me of February 10th, 2020, the day that Matt told me that we had to proactively cancel WordCamp Asia. That week was truly heartbreaking for me as well as I think the entire organizing team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it also, fortunately, was prescient. As I think back over the two years since then, I&#8217;m grateful for our community wranglers and deputies who have consistently hosted important discussions about how to return to in-person events safely. And with two of our major flagship events returning this year, I&#8217;m here to summarize, sort of, what the rules and guidelines are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But certainly I hope that you come away from this with an idea of what&#8217;s being done to keep everyone safe as we are best able.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:44]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, before we dig into specifics, I want to be clear upfront that the guidelines for COVID-aware events are mandatory, unless otherwise stated. For folks who&#8217;ve been attending WordPress events, or participating in the community for a long time, this is a change. As a program, we have always done our best to be flexible with guidelines so that we can prioritize local knowledge. But our responsibility is to the long-term success of this community and this program. So moving forward with in-person events that risk the health of our community members poses risks to the program itself. So with that in mind, let&#8217;s learn what we&#8217;re going to see at events for the rest of the.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:02:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For any WordPress event that is gathering more than 50 people, the new mandatory guidelines are:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Number one, follow local laws and guidelines. If your area has suggested guidelines on top of the mandatory ones, follow those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, is if you are in a location where laws or guidelines require or permit venues to limit admission based on a person&#8217;s vaccination status and masking, then events can only happen in venues that are willing to provide staff to check for vaccination status at the door. And then also to remind participants to wear masks during the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing is if your area or venue legally cannot check vaccination status, your area must pass the in-person checklist, which I will link in the show notes below. But that in-person checklist has to be passed at the time of the application and then again at the time of the event. And in addition to that, the venue must be willing to provide staff who will remind participants to wear masks and check for temperature during the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizers in these areas must be prepared to move online or cancel if the region fails the safety checklist, which again, will be linked in the show notes below. So those are the three things and they are pretty dense, but also I think allow for a fair amount of flexibility. There is also a tidy flow chart linked in the sidebar of make.wordpress.org/community that will help you to decide what sort of event your own area can support right now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those are the mandatory guidelines for WordPress events in general right now, but you probably also have a few specific questions. So I&#8217;ve got the three most common questions ready to go with answers from Angela Jin who helped me to kind of pull together the information for this particular podcast props to Angela. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:25]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, first question, anything specific to know about WordCamp Europe? WordCamp Europe will be following these guidelines as well. All attendees and participants are expected to wear a mask while they are at the event and catering will be offered outside so people can remove their masks to eat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second common question is how will these guidelines change as countries and local governments begin deescalating restrictions and safety measures? We should consider these guidelines to be subject to evolution based on what the team is hearing and seeing from the community. But right now we intend to keep these stricter guidelines in place until we see how the loosened rules play out elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then a third frequent question is what&#8217;s going to happen to all these online events?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community team will continue to support online events right now. So if your community doesn&#8217;t feel ready to have an in-person event, but still wants to kind of get everyone together that is still allowed, and still&nbsp; encouraged. And finally the community team will continue to keep a close eye on situations around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it becomes safe to do so, and your community is interested, they of course will be happy to chat with you about a WordCamp. There is an application that I will share the link to in the show notes below as well. In case that is something that your community is wanting to look into.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and I have a little postscript also. I know I was like finally, and now I&#8217;m doing a finally, finally. That&#8217;s what postscripts are about. P.S. If you have not stopped by the community team’s site or any of their meetings, they&#8217;ve been doing a really great job of keeping things moving through two years of unpredictable changes. If you are a community team member, I want to offer you a huge thanks. Thank you so much for helping us to stay aware and able to move forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are an organizer, pat yourself on the back. I want to thank you for pivoting with us, moving through online events, even though they are not at all the same as in-person events and certainly they don&#8217;t share the reasons that we get people together sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, if you are an end to end attendee, if you go to WordPress meetups or you go to any sort of WordPress online events or WordCamps, anything like that, thank your local organizer. They have been doing this probably for a while, and I&#8217;m sure that they are looking forward to getting back to in-person events themselves, but even, so they have been putting in a lot of volunteer hours to help make sure that we all know how to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so find them, thank them, and I&#8217;m sure that they&#8217;ll appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:07:20]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that, it is time for our small list of big things. Number one, WordCamp Asia has a call for organizers open! This event will be in 2023. And I think that we all simply cannot wait. So I&#8217;ll link the call for organizers in the show notes. And then of course you can follow that whole site to stay up to date on what&#8217;s happening there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is, while we&#8217;re on the topic of events, there&#8217;s also an open discussion about how we can best support organizers who are getting back to in-person events. We&#8217;d like thoughts from both organizers and attendees. So feel free to drop by and leave a note in the comments section. And while you&#8217;re over there, the third thing in my small list of big things, there&#8217;s also an open discussion about regional events. So go over there, get all your thoughts about WordPress events together. Get them all sorted out in one go. Just leave comments, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. All over the place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:08:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my most embarrassing WordCamp story actually has to do with where I was supposed to be versus where people thought I was supposed to be. This was early on in my time with WordPress, with Automattic. And I had convinced someone, I had convinced a colleague and friend of mine to go to my home WordCamp, WordCamp Fayetteville over there in Arkansas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I didn&#8217;t go. But I knew I wasn&#8217;t going, I knew I was going to WordCamp Boston, but he did not know that I was not going to go. And so he arrived at WordCamp Fayetteville, WordCamp Northwest Arkansas. I can&#8217;t remember what it was called at the time. And immediately was confused about where I was and why I wasn&#8217;t there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there was this excellent moment of mass confusion among states where the folks at WordCamp Fayetteville started tweeting about how I had convinced this contributor to go to that event and then didn&#8217;t show up. And then the folks at WordCamp Boston, we&#8217;re looking at all of those tweets, because if you are a WordCamp organizer, you are always looking at the tweets from all the other WordCamps happening in your weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And people got very confused about why I was in Boston while they were thinking that I was in Fayetteville, even though the tweets were talking about how, like, I wasn&#8217;t in Fayetteville. They probably didn&#8217;t say that it was probably more along the lines of like, “Hey, let&#8217;s share a photo with Josepha” to, like, make fun of the fact that I wasn&#8217;t there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I caused mass confusion in multiple states.

For Juan Aldasoro, a developer and product manager for a large distributed company, it provides an opportunity to combine his different interests and skills to live the type of life he wanted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I like visual, creative and technical things. The joy of WordPress is that you can do all of these things, you don’t have to limit yourself to any one aspect . You can also do this from almost anywhere in the world!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From working in products since 2012, Juan sees WordPress as a major part of his skillset and toolbox. He said: “It gives you an opportunity to be part of building a product which could potentially be used by thousands of people and more on your site. It encourages you to think about different languages and how you can make it accessible. It allows you to work on different platforms. Working in WordPress gives you this broad approach. Working this way on products ended up pushing me into learning about all these different things. Only in open source can you really do this and use your creative side to find solutions.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Learning about being part of a community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"924\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813.jpeg?resize=1024%2C924&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan standing in a astreet with murals behind him\" class=\"wp-image-12529\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C924&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=300%2C271&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C693&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1386&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1847&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Born in a mid-sized city in Argentina, Juan was raised in a family in which music, arts and sports were always an essential part of everyday life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“These activities encourage human beings to be creative and participative, and at the same time they are highly formative when it comes to mould people in order to become part of a group, a team, a community.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The youngest of five siblings, Juan became highly motivated, trying to follow the steps of his siblings. Having a computer at home, he started to make connections that laid the foundation for his career as a developer. His interest in computers grew through that access to a machine running MS-DOS &#8211; the one with the black screen command line! Mastering this became a challenge to him and something to share with others. Through doing this, he found a way to more social interaction and new friendships.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Without being conscious of it, my friends and I were sharing pieces of code.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “I started learning some super easy stuff that made me feel like Houdini at that time. I could save a game play, something intangible, on a floppy disk and carry that piece of plastic and magnetic material back home. I was saving the play or game in a square object and then loading that back at home. I now realize, those were my first interactions with computer commands. Without being conscious of it, my friends and I were sharing pieces of code in a unique way.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This interest grew further through computer magazines and experimenting as &#8220;there was always something new to learn.” Although sport became a big part of Juan’s life in his teens, he kept up his computer learning. Taking a new direction, he found online tutorials enabling him to learn how to play the guitar. This led to setting up a punk rock band with his friends.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Education has always been important in my family, and thanks to my parent’s efforts, I attended a school where I learned to express myself in another language.” The school had hired a satellite internet connection in the mid-nineties and had HTML on the computer studies program. These facilities were not that common in Argentina or many other countries either at that time. Also, his parents had the foresight to secure a rare internet connection at the house in 1997. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan recalled: “Browsing around the Internet opened a new universe in my mind. This new universe was extremely fantastic but also extremely expensive. I needed to make the most of every second online.”<br><br>“It was a whole new world and one thing led to the other. I started learning a bit of everything, editing graphics, scripting and so on. I still remember my first website in the fantastic sunset strip, Geocities.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Trying to go pro</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After high school, Juan moved to the city along with his brother and began to study IT at University. When he was asked by a friend to work at a software company, he decided to try that whilst continuing his studies. Through his job he had the chance to explore web-related opportunities, and with a friend from university, they started managing teams and projects across Latin America and Spain.<br><br>Juan describes this experience as one of the most fulfilling in his life. He was able to travel abroad for work, experience remote working, manage teams, present projects and speak formally in front of senior people. As the company grew at a fast pace, they learned how to set up and run a large organization. Eventually, he decided to drop out of his university program and focus on the opportunity of learning first hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan riding a bicycle in a historical city during his travels\" class=\"wp-image-12509\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the key early learning from working internationally was that business and web development could be just as fast-moving and successful in Argentina as in other places. “I realized there’s no such thing as a secret sauce for success. Projects are backed by people’s talent and time, and you can find that in any latitude.”<br><br>By his mid-20s, Juan decided he wanted to try building something from scratch. He created a social network for photo sharing in Latin America, which was used by more than 30,000 people across Latin America and Spain in its time. Through this, he discovered that other people had a blog and he did not want to be left behind. The discovery of WordPress was to change the focus of his life.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hello to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Spending some time traveling around Europe, Juan found himself ‘surrounded by uncertainty’ and worried about what the future could bring. “I had some clues, but under uncertainty, the more you ask the less you answer. I started thinking about embracing the following philosophy: I didn’t want to be part of a large company, I didn’t want to continue studying and I wanted to travel as much as I could.” He did not realize at that time how this vision for his life was to mirror what he would find in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He started using WordPress for a few sites in 2005. By 2007 he was using it for almost everything. He was struck by the magnitude and range of what the software could do, from a simple tool used to create a blog in the blink of an eye through to complex projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His first problem-solving project was simple and saved data received through a contact form plugin. “To complete this project I discovered the Codex and I learned how easy and intuitive it is to create a plugin. I had fallen in love with WordPress.”</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I was truly amazed by how I could learn from others.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As he explored the options with the software, Juan was unsure of how intellectual property worked and wanted to be respectful of other people’s work. “I didn’t understand open source yet, and I wasn’t sure if I was stealing from others. That was my first interaction with GPL and open source. I was truly amazed by how I could learn from others and improve things created by others or by myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He realized: “WordPress was the way to go if I wanted to pursue a dream of traveling, skipping winter, and working at the same time; what we now call a digital nomad. I already knew how to work remotely, I could work for companies located anywhere, as long as they could communicate in English or Spanish.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan started his own web agency, where he provided services to small and medium-sized companies abroad in the USA, UK, and Australia. He built his reputation and developed strong relationships in WordPress. “The experience couldn’t be better. I was learning, having fun, making a living out of it, and at the same time exploring the world.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In mid-2012, he discovered the full power of the WordPress community firsthand. In his spare time he started developing themes and from all he heard, wanted to attend a major event with lots of others in WordPress, a WordCamp. He took the plunge and booked for WordCamp in Edinburgh, in the UK. He said: “I got to meet many super talented people, and the atmosphere of the event was awesome. A place where competitors were also colleagues. Seeing the humility of somebody like Mike Little, the co-founder of WordPress, was amazing.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “While there, unconsciously, I started dreaming of holding something like that in Argentina &#8211; the joy of hosting the WordPress community in my home country.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back home, while browsing the Codex, he happened to see that WordPress was turning 10. A lot of meetups were going to be organized worldwide to celebrate the birthday. But there was nothing organized in Argentina. This was a catalyst for starting a local meetup. Together with a colleague, he&nbsp; organized an Argentinian 10th birthday meetup. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than 20 people showed up. “There was a common denominator. We all loved WordPress, it was part of our day-to-day life. We wanted to share experiences, make new friends and continue growing from what we could learn from others. That day we were a group of people with shared interests. That’s the simplest way to define a community, isn’t it?” This early meetup led to the formation of what is now called <a href=\"http://wpargentina.org/\">WordPress Argentina</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his desire to skip winters and do more traveling, his next adventure was to take him to visit family working in the US and attend one of the biggest WordCamps in the world in San Francisco. His interest kept growing and he traveled across Europe to be part of the first edition of WordCamp Europe in the Netherlands in 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “There’s almost nothing I could write to fully express what you experience in such events. They are the main WordPress events worldwide. The best part: I made a lot of good friends from many different places. I’m glad I have more excuses to continue traveling.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once again in Argentina, our organization started growing thanks to the energy of the whole group, we started hosting formal meetups. In May 2015, we crowned all these efforts with a new <a href=\"https://buenosaires.wordcamp.org/2015/\">WordCamp in Buenos Aires</a>, Argentina.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan speaking at WordCamp Buenos Aires\" class=\"wp-image-12528\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Organizing such an event in my home country with many of the contributors I had met from the very first meetup was an experience I will always keep with me.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan believes one of his biggest contributions to open source was as part of being able to expand the community in Argentina and to share this with other Latin American and Spanish speaking countries. He also contributes as a volunteer translator in the Polyglots Team, to the Make WordPress Support team, and contributes to code blocks and Gutenberg. “I am really excited about seeing the future of Gutenberg as it is the future of WordPress.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout his time contributing, Juan believes in helping to set the foundations and encouraging others to give their time and talents. He is keen to share that contributing does not have to be the same all the time and that you can have breaks and focus on one area in a particular period too. He gives the example of how in his spare time he watches Trac, where tickets about the software are logged, and looks where he might be able to help or think of solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “Anytime I find I can contribute to or make improvements in code-related areas, I will do as it is important to keep giving to the community. I enjoy crawling over meta, trac, GitHub and the different places that are requesting help. There is always somewhere you can help. At the moment, my focus is code and translations. I always try to save time to help these two areas. It is like you give and you get, you learn things. You meet amazing people and opportunities arrive.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding your path in WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505.jpeg?resize=768%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan sat in a street cafe surrounded by parked motorcycles\" class=\"wp-image-12527\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=1152%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1152w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Life is about experiences, it is about the people you surround yourself with and trying to do what you love.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we&#8217;re talking about who WordPress is built for. I was talking to a group of contributors last week and we encountered some questions around just who WordPress is built for. And it&#8217;s a question that you&#8217;ll find any time that you&#8217;re working on user testing or on triaging tickets, and especially when that comes up when you look at the big picture, roadmap sorts of things. The easiest answer for this question is, of course, everyone because WordPress&#8217; mission is to democratize publishing and that should be available to everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>[00:01:11]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, everyone is a really big target and certainly doesn&#8217;t help get your mind around the people that you&#8217;re wanting to actually build it for, the people that you actually want to be able to use your product, your software on a day-to-day basis. So let&#8217;s take a look at the one question that can help us figure out who it&#8217;s built for today and how we get it to being something that&#8217;s built forever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, there&#8217;s a basic premise of open source that informs this thought. And that premise is that we are citizens of a community of contributors therefore the decisions are made by the people who show up. In general, I believe that to be true, though, I also believe that some basic qualifications are needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:50]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with that in mind, the one question that can help us figure out who a software is built for is this: how do your active contributors see themselves? I would bet that most contributors to open source software projects, like WordPress, are developers of some sort, it is sort of written right into the definition of the project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you work on software, then you need developers. And what I love about WordPress, in particular, is that we do work to include contributors who are not developers. Yet it still remains true that there is a fairly high level of technical knowledge required to actively contribute.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:2:25]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which kind of brings us to the second half of the original question of how can we make sure that WordPress can be something that&#8217;s built for everyone? The answer to this one is easy to say, hard to do, and that is to make sure to include them as co-creators in the development process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve talked about co-creators in open source before. It&#8217;s this idea that people who use the software every day are likely to know the biggest pain points. So if you want your software to be used by people who don&#8217;t know HTML, talk to a bunch of people who don&#8217;t know HTML about how it is to use your software.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want your software to be mostly used by enterprise agencies, talk to enterprise agencies, but also ask them what their clients hate, because everyone has more than one stakeholder. And I know that I said this already, but it bears repeating that, obviously, this is all very easy to say and hard to do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:3:20]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what is my best guess for the how-to-do part for WordPress? There are three things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first is testing. This not only helps bring in new contributors and helps train future contributors, which I&#8217;ve talked about on the podcast before. But testing also gives us a higher chance of actionable feedback from folks who don&#8217;t necessarily spend time directly in the WordPress project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frequently the feedback that we do get that is just kind of undirected and ad hoc is exactly that– it is undirected and ad hoc and is then hard to follow up on and make sure that we understand what was wrong and how we can help fix it. And so testing is important for that. And testing it turns out is important for a bunch of things. When you&#8217;re working in open source.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing is support. So checking in with support teams at hosts, as well as the hardworking support teams in the project. And that can really help us to get early indications of what difficulties exist now. They have routinely seen problems and issues that are raised in support forums, and from their everyday users that they are providing support to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That probably could be fixed in WordPress if we had a good understanding of just what was not going right, how many people really needed it to go better, and what our targets were to fix that particular problem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:4:45]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing is communication. I know that I&#8217;ve gone on record in many places as saying that most of our problems at the end of the day are communication problems. And I&#8217;m going on record about it again here in this podcast, establishing better communication patterns with users is key.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That can be a multi-year project in itself. And even after that, it&#8217;s going to be an ongoing journey. But it is one of the many things that WordCamps and other WordPress events have given to us over the years, an opportunity to really hear from and see the struggles that people who are not building with WordPress every day, or literally building WordPress every day are actually having.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:5:34]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now that you&#8217;ve heard my small list of way too big things, that brings us to our regular small list of big things. The first thing is that WordCamp Europe is still looking for volunteers. If you&#8217;ve never done that before, I think it&#8217;s quite fun. You get to meet a lot of people and the team of organizers is super fun, but I&#8217;ll leave a link for you in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a new code-free way to contribute through the photo directory. That team is just getting started and still is working toward building out its programs. So now&#8217;s a good time to drop in and just kind of see what they are up to. And finally, a reminder that we do have contributors who are affected by the war in Ukraine right now. I will reshare the list of humanitarian organizations in case you missed them a couple of weeks ago as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:6:21]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for this WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12451\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"WordPress 5.9.2 Security and Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/03/wordpress-5-9-2-security-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 02:24:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"5.9\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12421\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:367:\"WordPress 5.9.2&#160;is now available!

I have Matt here with me today because we want to acknowledge that we are once again at the start of a very difficult time. Neither of us would presume to know what it&#8217;s like to be at the heart of such massive disruption in our lives. But who would we be if we didn&#8217;t stop and check in with you all, the project that we hold so dear? And with that, I&#8217;ll hand it right over to you, Matt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>00:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello everyone. First, I want to thank Josepha for inviting me to join the WordPress Briefing to share what’s been on my mind in light of recent global events.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>00:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been listening and watching events escalate in Ukraine, often in a state of shock. The scale alone is hard to take in. I mean, in the last 7 days, more than 500,000 people have fled their homes, more refugees are expected every day. The downstream humanitarian crises of the invasion are unimaginable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>00:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And seeing destruction in the world we live in is confusing, disconcerting, and difficult. In my experience, open source and WordPress bring people together; people from other countries and cultures, people that we know as friends and colleagues. Technology connects us, regardless of where we are. Nothing can negate the bad things happening in the world, but when I see how this community of contributors collaborates, regardless of borders, you all remind me of the good in the world every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>01:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I firmly believe that the web can be an equalizer and a force for good in the world. To me, the WordPress project is the epitome of goodness—everyone has a voice, a platform, and a community. You have the power to make your corner of the world, and the web, a sanctuary for those who need it—especially now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>01:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you or someone you know is affected by this war, I encourage you to be present as the ramifications unfold. While we may all feel fatigued and have a sense of languishing from the past two years of the Covid pandemic, the gift of time and support for one another cannot be overstated. I&#8217;m confident that every single person in the WordPress community will approach the situation in Ukraine with sensitivity and understanding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>02:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I invite you to join me in standing with those in the world working to end conflict and working toward a world of peace, promise, and opportunity. If you&#8217;re looking for a way to help support the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, I will offer some suggested NGOs, or Non-Governmental Organizations, that provide assistance to local peacebuilders in the region.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>02:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In closing, please know that my thoughts are with everyone in our community. I know that my words here can’t change anything there, but I hope that we all remember that words of support are never unwelcome. And we can never know when a little human kindness can help someone share the invisible heaviness in their heart.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for that, Matt.

In 2007, Tonya started to face health challenges that had an impact on all that she had known.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>“My career defined me. It was my canvas and my art. When it was gone, I did not recognize myself.</strong></p><cite>Tonya Mork</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>One day, she woke up at home ready to visit a client’s facility where her firm was building a robotic system. She said: “As I headed for the door, I fell to my knees, as this wave of pain crushed down on my chest.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doctors diagnosed her with a very rare heart disease that caused her blood vessels to spasm, cutting off blood to whatever was downstream of the blockage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months later, she was diagnosed with a second rare and more serious condition, related to the migraines from which she had been suffering. Combined with her heart condition, this made every migraine attack life-threatening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For nearly seven years, the unexpected changes to her health left her mostly homebound and constantly monitored. This meant she had to close her engineering firm and say goodbye to staff and clients. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“My career defined me. It was my canvas and my art. When it was gone, I was lost. I didn’t recognize myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in her darkest hour, she found her strength. Tonya made a choice to move forward, and make the most of her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When you are at rock bottom, you have to make a decision or else it will consume you. My decision was that I chose to be happy,” said Tonya.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Tonya’s first steps was to start writing a blog using WordPress. In this she shared insights on how to find peace and joy in any situation. She wrote about kindness and helping one another.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The joy of making solutions through WordPress became a way for Tonya to accept her new life and not feel as limited by her health. She wanted purpose, and in WordPress, she found just that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya felt she could do something worthwhile in the virtual world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"a-ray-of-hope-for-tonya\">A ray of hope for Tonya</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya.jpg?resize=1000%2C750&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12327\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2013, Tonya’s health deteriorated further. She was admitted into intensive care and was diagnosed with a third rare disease, this time related to her autoimmunity. She was not expected to survive this time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following what she describes as a ‘miraculous recovery,’ she became stronger and was able to stop relying on a wheelchair. She used the energy from working on websites to keep going. “WordPress kept my mind alive,” said Tonya.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She had first used WordPress for her engineering firm’s intranet. But when she discovered the software’s full potential and the collaborative opportunities of open source, it opened a new world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>&#8220;Finding WordPress helped me to find myself again&#8221;</p><cite>Tonya Mork</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>During the years which followed, she donated her time to build some WordPress websites and plugins. She said: “Through giving my time, I was able to do something other than sit in isolation.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya was amazed by the sharing in open source in general and in WordPress in particular. She said: “I was amazed to see people sharing so much information freely with one another. In my former engineering world, information was proprietary. Throughout my career, I had worked to break down those silos and help anyone to understand complex systems. I was drawn to this open community.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also became aware that WordPress developers were hungry to learn more about development. She wanted to be part of the solution with her passion for teaching and the knowledge she had gained in industry.<br><br>She said: “Finding WordPress helped me to find myself again. Here in this community, I was able to feel like a person again, not a sick one, but a professional with something to give.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As her interest in the software grew, Tonya decided to start a non-profit where she turned to WordPress to build the websites. This re-sparked her interest in programming. She said: “I wanted to really know the code and understand what made it tick.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The realization led Tonya to start the WP Developers’ Club, which in turn spawned <a href=\"https://knowthecode.io/\">Know the Code</a>, to help educate individual developers, and is still used today.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"from-helping-wordpress-companies-to-working-on-wordpress-core\">From helping WordPress companies to working on WordPress Core</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya-with-dog.jpg?resize=300%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Tonya pictured with her dog\" class=\"wp-image-12328\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya-with-dog.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya-with-dog.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya went on to work with big and medium size WordPress companies helping their developers and supporting them in raising their firms’ leverage with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By late 2020, she knew she wanted to do even more with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In February 2021, Tonya joined an international firm in the ecosystem and began working closely on WordPress Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time, WordPress Core was pulling together a new Triage team. Tonya started volunteering on that team to find collaborative solutions, and help others do so. In 2020 for <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/12/simone/\">WordPress 5.6 Simone</a>, she became the release’s Triage lead, and again for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-7/\">WordPress 5.7 Esperanza</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, she became a Test Team Rep and helped to expand the team and is an advocate for the value of testing and feedback in the release development process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"a-new-successful-chapter-with-wordpress-5-9\">A new, successful chapter with WordPress 5.9</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=1024%2C480&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Tonya was one of the notable contributors to the WordPress 5.9 release featured in this picture.\" class=\"wp-image-12329\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=1024%2C480&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=300%2C141&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=768%2C360&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=1536%2C719&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=2048%2C959&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya’s passion for the software and getting people involved in its growth continued. For the WordPress 5.9 release in 2021, she took on the role of both the Core Tech Lead and the Release Coordinator. As this was a big release and included the first major implementation of Full Site Editing, it had many moving parts and hundreds of contributors. She was able to share the skills she had learned in communication and project management from her days streamlining and documenting engineering software and processes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first 24 hours of WordPress 5.9 landing, it had more than 10 million downloads—and 17 formally reported bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"giving-back-to-open-source\">Giving back to open source</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now in what Tonya describes as her third chapter. She said: “I’m a very different person from the engineer I used to know. What really matters in this world is when you reach out and make a difference in someone’s life.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She feels she has found her purpose in this life. “I’m on a mission to give back and make a difference. Teaching is how I will do it. And in WordPress I have found my professional home, and I have all this software knowledge that I just want to share.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"share-the-stories\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"contributors-to-this-feature\">Contributors to this feature</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to Tonya Mork (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/hellofromtonya/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>hellofromtonya</a>) for sharing her story. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interviews and feature by Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>) and Mary Baum (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>marybaum</a>).

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project. Some insight into the community that supports it and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy &#8211; here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:00:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a non-mailbag mailbag question that I would like to answer for y&#8217;all today. Non-mailbag because no one actually emailed me about it and mailbag because Twitter is basically like a giant mailbag. And I do get a lot of DMS about this particular topic. If you want to send something to my actual WP Briefing mailbag, you can send it to <a href=\"mailto:wpbriefing@worpress.org\">wpbriefing@worpress.org</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:06]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the question that I frequently get asked in my DMS on Twitter is: what is Five for the Future? It&#8217;s not always that tidy the question, but that still is the question we&#8217;re answering today. So if you take a casual survey of active contributors to the WordPress project, the high-level answer that you&#8217;re likely to get to that question is “a way to remind people to give back to the project.” Or, if you run in more business-y circles, you might hear that it is an initiative that encourages companies to give back 5% of their resources.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And both of those answers are true. So a quick mini-history lesson; the original concept of Five for the Future came from Matt Mullenweg in 2014. There&#8217;s a lovely blog post on it that I will link in the notes below, but it was essentially a call to any companies experiencing success with WordPress to contribute back to the project and make sure that the project was a success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:02:07]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial program then included outreach recognition, et cetera, proposed in 2017 by <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/liljimmi/\">Tracy Levesque</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/iandunn/\">Ian Dunn</a>. Then that was defined and formalized with the help of the WordPress community in 2018. And then, in 2019, we had our first trial run with entire dedicated teams sponsored by companies inside the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:02:36]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the mini-history lesson chronology of this program. The intentions that informed the work of building the program in 2017 have become a bit lost to the ages. So I&#8217;m here to share it with you. The basic heart and soul of the Five for the Future program is to make sure that there is a way to refresh the commons of the WordPress community and ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a result, ensure that the common resources of WordPress are available long after we have stopped being available to care for them. If you are familiar with the concept of the tragedy of the commons, Five for the Future was created to help avoid that tragedy. There were two original goals for formalizing the program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:22]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one was to acknowledge companies that participated in Five for the Future by sponsoring contributors to work on the WordPress project. And the second was to motivate more companies to sponsor more volunteers. Either by hiring them and paying them to contribute or by assigning their existing employees to contribute to the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:46]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, it&#8217;s hard to quantify participation and hard to qualify what should be seen as an impactful contribution, which is why when the program was originally created, it was in partnership with team reps and community members who were active at the time. There are many posts around that discuss the next steps for this program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:07]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I&#8217;m looking through them, the next steps revolve around some of the hardest and most important questions that we have to answer as a project and as stewards of open source. Those questions are things like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li> How do we remain true to these gloriously subversive values of WordPress and open source while also finding a way to thoughtfully secure our organization&#8217;s future?</li><li>Does contributing without the expectation of reciprocity hold up when we are looking at how to acknowledge contributors who sustain us?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re familiar with Elinor Ostrom&#8217;s award-winning work, Governing the Commons, you may also be wondering how this particular program aligns with her eight principles designed to sustain organizations like ours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:57]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an aside to that last question, this particular program does not have all eight principles accounted for, but among WordPress&#8217;s many programs, we do account for most of them. Although imperfectly, as is the way with human beings, that&#8217;s probably a whole episode unto itself, I did want to quickly answer that particular question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:16]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to get back to my non-mailbag, mailbag question, if I had to tell you in the span of an elevator ride what Five for the Future was, this would be my answer. <strong>It is a v1 program with a dual goal of boldly declaring the need to refresh the shared resources of WordPress and offering the ways and means for communities and individuals alike to participate in refreshing those resources</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:45]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to learn more about the Five for the Future initiative, you can check out wordpress.org/5. Like literally just the number five. Or, if you want to learn more about the program that has grown from the Five for the Future initiative, you can check out the white paper that&#8217;s linked in the notes below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:06:11]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. Number one on my small list, the planning post for WordPress 6.0 is out. I&#8217;ve included a link in my massive list of links below. But it includes our best guess at timing, features that we intend to include, and a call for volunteers as well. So if you are looking for ways to give back, that is a clear and immediate option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:06:38]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on the list is if you are a team rep, don&#8217;t forget that we have daylight saving time ending and starting depending on your hemisphere within the month. If you move meetings, if you&#8217;re in a team that moves your meetings, discuss it now so that folks have time to adjust their calendars.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:06:55]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing on my small list of big things is that there&#8217;s a suite of Full Site Editing courses that are now available on learn.wordpress.org. I will add that to my giant list of links below, but I encourage you to wander on over and see what all the fuss is about. I think the courses are excellent.

Some insight into the community that supports it and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of weeks ago, I published a post about the big picture goals for the WordPress project in 2022. As I was thinking through our planned releases for the year and looking out toward what would spell success for WordPress over the next three years, three things really lined up in both sets of answers for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I provided some detail on how we can work toward these goals in the post, which I will link for you in the show notes, but I also wanted to take some time to explain why I feel we have to work toward these goals this year. So these all build on one another. To refresh your memory of the three big focuses, they are one to drive adoption of the new editor in WordPress, support open source alternatives for site building necessities, and three, open source stewardship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:52</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first one; is driving the adoption of the new WordPress editor. Early on in the start of the Gutenberg Project, folks could not go two days without hearing me talk about the phases of adoption and how those line up with the phases of Gutenberg, and who would need our support the most in each of those phases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have always believed that what we would be shipping at this point in our project would prove the plausible promise of what we were doing in phase one. That&#8217;s definitely what I&#8217;m seeing from what was shipped in 5.9, as well as what we plan to ship in May with 6.0. And the people who need the most support right now are absolutely our users, your clients, no matter whether they were not keeping up with WordPress developments or simply were waiting to see what all the fuss was about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be people who look to you as someone who has been here a while to help them make sense of what they&#8217;re seeing. And what I find so exciting about this adoption, sort of, work in the WordPress project is that this is the time when we as practitioners of WordPress, no matter whether you are a designer or a developer or builder, business coach. This is the time when we get to guide others through the hardest parts of our learning processes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The process of helping people to learn new technologies relies not only on your hard-won expertise but also on the belief that the future is worth fighting for. Enabling someone’s success is an investment in the future and investment for that person or for WordPress or your community. All investments are welcome here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:28</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, table stakes are just that you care. And speaking of future investments, the second focus is open source alternatives for site building necessities. So things like images, forms, stores, themes, etc. It literally just things you need to build a site. I would like to start by saying that I am completely aware of the fact that 99% of WordPress users will never care about open source freedoms and philosophies in the same way that WordPress maintainers and contributors care about open source freedoms and philosophies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could substitute the name of any other open source project right there, and the statement would still be true. And yet, I will always believe that people should have the rights and freedoms that open source brings to them even if they do not know they are there. And so it makes all the sense in the world to me that as a project and open source community, we should strive to make choosing Open Source as easy as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, open source stewardship is one of the focuses for this year. This one is obviously about supporting open source as a concept and maintaining WordPress as a project. But I also think that it is relevant to our current global circumstances. Open Source suddenly became very visible to the public eye last year following the Log4J vulnerability, and ever since then, I&#8217;ve been hearing consistent concern over how We make sure that WordPress is sustainable moving into the future. Fortunately, this is a topic that&#8217;s near and dear to my heart. And I have been delighted to see so many community members bringing that conversation to the forefront.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:14</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a lot that is done in the WordPress project to keep us from the tragedy of the commons. But that work honestly never ends. Not only does it not end, but as we get bigger, there is more and more that we can and should be doing to keep us around for the long term. And, of course, for the keen readers of my posts, there&#8217;s a bonus focus.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bonus focus is, of course, that WordPress turns 20 years old next year. This year, we will also be seeing some preparatory work for that major milestone as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that brings us today to our small list of big things. There is a redesign of the News Page coming. We&#8217;ve been talking about this over on make.wordpress.org/design for a bit since like June of last year or something. But it&#8217;s coming in the next few weeks. I&#8217;ll share a link to the GitHub repo in case anyone has any specific things that they see as they are reading through all of our many news stories that come out on that particular page.

This is more than just a new default theme. It’s a brand-new way to work with WordPress themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/block-themes/\">Block themes</a> put a wide array of visual choices directly in your hands, from color schemes and font combinations to page templates and image filters, all from the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/site-editor/\">Site Editor</a>. So in one place, you can give Twenty Twenty-Two the same look and feel as your organization’s other materials—or take your site’s look in another direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You already have the Twenty Twenty-Two theme—it came installed with WordPress 5.9. You will find it with your other installed themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"903\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-2.png?resize=1204%2C903&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12102\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-2.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-2.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-2.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-2.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"your-personal-paintbox-awaits\">Your personal paintbox awaits</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Twenty Twenty-Two is not the only theme built for full site editing. More block themes are in the Themes directory, and the number will grow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you use any of those new themes, you no longer need the Customizer. Instead, you have all the power of the Styles interface inside the Site Editor. Just as in Twenty Twenty-Two, you build your site’s look and feel there, with the tools you need for the job in a fluid interface that practically comes alive in your hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"903\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-3.png?resize=1204%2C903&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12103\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-3.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-3.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-3.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-3.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"the-navigation-block\">The Navigation block</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Blocks come to site navigation, the heart of user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Navigation block gives you the power to choose: an always-on responsive menu or one that adapts to your user’s screen size.

And you can edit them as you see fit. Need something different in the header or footer for your theme? Swap it out with a new one in a few clicks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a nearly full-screen view that draws you in to see fine details, the Pattern Explorer makes it easy to compare patterns and choose the one your users need.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"903\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-6.png?resize=1204%2C903&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12106\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-6.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-6.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-6.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-6.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"a-revamped-list-view\">A revamped List View</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 5.9, the List View lets you drag and drop your content exactly where you want it.

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday marked three years since the WordPress project welcomed me as their executive director. As I start my fourth year, I&#8217;ve spent a bit of time considering what the next five years will bring us. WordPress will turn 19 this year, which means that we will soon be a whopping 20 years old; for some of the people who have been with the project since the beginning, that can represent two-thirds of their whole life. And even if you were not that young when you got here, two decades as an open source project is really a cause for celebration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am not in that group that has been here forever. I showed up for the first time in 2009, as a community organizer, self-sponsored, and I learned so much about myself as a person and as a leader while I was doing that. So when I arrived as a sponsored contributor in 2015, I already knew exactly what made this work so fulfilling for me was these three things:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, the ability to lend a hand in those moments where I wish someone had lent a hand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second is the delight of seeing people&#8217;s first successes and the joy of watching them grow over time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:48</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third was a chance to be part of something great, which turned out to be something greater; greater than me or you or a CMS.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:58</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This list is still at the heart of what I feel I get out of the WordPress project. But it has also grown substantially in my seven years as a sponsored contributor. I now also love how we as a community of contributors get to foster a better way to lead and a better way to collaborate. And through those things help people find a way to have a better life. Not just through WordPress, the CMS, but through WordPress, the people, and WordPress, the project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:25</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so when I think of what I want for WordPress in its 19th year, so that we can head with confidence and dignity into our 20th year, it is this:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want you to remember that you are not alone here. People come together in the world often because of a shared location. But WordPress fosters this beautiful experience of bringing us together because of what we care about. Whether you care about PHP standards, diversity in technology, helping people with their first big wins, making WordPress more secure. I mean, if what you care about is being able to write the most arcane and complex apps on top of WordPress that the world has ever seen. Then there are others out there who want to do that with you, too. We have so many things to connect about. And fortunately, we support a great piece of software for getting our thoughts out in the world. Take some time to see who else shares your thoughts and potentially learn a bit about the view from the other side.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of the other side, I also want us to approach our discussions as the US versus the Problem TM. WordPress may be 20 years old, and we may stand on the shoulders of giants, but right now, the people who are here you, you are explorers and creators and guides toward the best possible future for WordPress. The tension that we witness between teams is always about the best possible answers for the people who use our software. It is about securing the freedoms of the open web for everyone who comes after us whether they know they need those freedoms or not.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, I want us to expand our reasons for doing this at all. If you are a member of the community of contributors, We frequently talk about how we give back because WordPress gave to us. Or if you are part of a Five for the Future group. You have heard that companies who have experienced success because of WordPress should commit 5% of their resources back to the project to ensure WordPress&#8217; long-term success. But the reason that I keep doing this, and hopefully a new reason for you to keep doing this is that we can take part in securing opportunities for future users of WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I want WordPress to be the best CMS. Yes, I want this community to be vibrant and engaged. Yes, I want WordPress to be a shining beacon of how to work remotely. And I want all of that because I know it is our careful and tireless stewardship of this project that lets us continue to lend a hand in those moments where people wish for someone to lend a hand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are my hopes for WordPress in 2022 to move us forward into WordPress of the future. I hope you all will come with me and we can continue our journey together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks again for listening. I&#8217;m Josepha Haden and this is the WP Briefing. See you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12043\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"WordPress 5.9 RC 2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/01/wordpress-5-9-rc-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 20:43:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:4:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"5.9\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"RC2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12014\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:117:\"The second Release Candidate (RC2) for WordPress 5.9 is available!

Testing for bugs is not just a critical part of polishing every release, it is also a great way to contribute to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-help\"><strong>How to Help</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2021/11/30/help-test-wordpress-5-9-features/\">Help test WordPress 5.9 features</a> – a guide to how you can take part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you write in another language other than English?

His fascination with development and learning continued to grow, and he now makes a living using WordPress and the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on to discover his story, which shows with creativity and determination you can create products and make a living using WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"starting-web-building-on-a-phone\"><strong>Starting web building on a phone</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"350\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/12/collins-agbonghama1.jpg?resize=350%2C426&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Collins Agbonghama headshot photo\" class=\"wp-image-11920\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/12/collins-agbonghama1.jpg?w=350&amp;ssl=1 350w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/12/collins-agbonghama1.jpg?resize=246%2C300&amp;ssl=1 246w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Collins began his exploration of the internet while attending Secondary School in Nigeria, or High School as it is known in some other countries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A friend at the school had a simple mobile phone which could browse the internet. Collins had his first introduction to the World Wide Web through access to this device. He became hooked by reading headlines on a sports site about a famous English Premier League Football Club, Chelsea, a soccer team which he has long supported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Being a very inquisitive person, I wanted to learn how the web works as well as have my own website. I was able to buy a classic mobile phone through the menial jobs I did after school,” he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His first website was a wapsite or Wireless Application Protocol site optimized for mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He took to Google to learn how to actually build a site. He discovered he needed something called an ‘email address’ to sign-up for site builders. Google Search came to the rescue again, and he created the first email account for his first website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A desire for a website was the catalyst for further learning, starting with HTML and CSS from an online provider. His interest in building sites with more advanced tools grew, and then he came across WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using his savings, he bought the cheapest hosting plan from a local Nigerian web host. He installed WordPress and started writing tutorials for a mobile device platform. He built the site, created the lessons, and started his entry into WordPress all on a mobile phone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This led to him having the confidence to start building sites for others, and he was able to earn a small income from that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collins said: “I couldn’t go to the university because of my precarious financial situation. I continued to do menial jobs during the day and started learning PHP in the evenings and at night using my mobile phone via online learning platforms.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was later able to get an old laptop, which helped him access ebooks to learn more and practice his coding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keen to share this learning, he started blogging about what he was learning on his website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collins said: “I later took up a job teaching children at a school primarily because I got tired of the menial jobs and wanted to earn enough to take care of my internet data plan. After a while, I became fairly proficient in PHP and even took up a job to build a school management system.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"using-wordpress-to-make-a-living\"><strong>Using WordPress to make a living</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Collins’ blog wasn’t making money through advertisements, but he discovered opportunities to write tutorials for other platforms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I started writing PHP and WordPress development tutorials and got paid a few hundred dollars per article. In Nigeria, that’s quite a lot of money. I was able to improve the life and wellbeing of my family and myself,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After getting into a higher education program to study computer science, his life dramatically changed. He decided to stop writing and began to focus on building and selling WordPress plugins.&nbsp;His first one was a user and profile plugin for WordPress sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Thankfully, after a year, it started making enough revenue for me to live pretty comfortably here in Nigeria because the cost of living here is relatively low,” he said</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Collins has several plugins which have given him a sustainable source of income. He’s also a Core and Translation volunteer contributor to the WordPress.org Open Source project. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>I am thankful for WordPress because without it, I’m really not sure I would have been able to live a decent quality life. <br>Who knows what would have become of me?</p><cite>Collins Agbonghama</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“I am also thankful for the community. I have made lots of friends that have been very supportive and helpful in my journey.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “I tell people, life won’t give you what you want. You demand from life what you want. You make these demands by being determined and never giving up on your dreams and aspirations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If you are poor, perhaps because you came from a humble and poor background, it is not your fault.

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project. Some insight into the community that supports it and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, ages and ages ago, when I first started this podcast, someone basically requested that Matt and I do a duet for the last podcast of the year. A Christmas carol duet; him on the saxophone and me on voice. I obviously did not get that coordinated I don&#8217;t even know why I said obviously. I&#8217;ll tell you right now I did not get that coordinated. I was a very busy lady this year. So I don&#8217;t have a Matt on saxophone. Still, I did think that maybe it might be nice just for me to sing a teensy little Christmas carol for you all just because it seems especially poignant the words this year, especially after the 2020, 2021 COVID, all the things and trying to get back in person. So I&#8217;m going to sing you all one little verse from <em>Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>01:35 <em>Singing</em>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have yourself a merry little Christmas</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let your heart be light</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From now on our troubles</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will be out of sight</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have yourself a merry little Christmas</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make the Yuletide gay</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From now on our troubles</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will be miles away</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we are as in olden days</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happy golden days of yore</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Faithful friends who are dear to us</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gather near to us, once more</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the years we all will be together</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the fates allow</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hang a shining star upon the highest bough</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And have yourself a merry little Christmas now</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we are as in olden days</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happy golden days of yore</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Faithful friends who are dear to us</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gather near to us, once more</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the years we all will be together</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the fates allow</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hang a shining star upon the highest bough</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And have yourself a merry little Christmas now</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, my friends, that was from my heart to yours if you happened to listen. If you skipped a few seconds to get through it, which I would totally understand, that is also fine. But I did want to just kind of wrap up the year to let you all know that I am so incredibly grateful for all of the people who show up for the WordPress project to make it a success. I have made so many friends and wonderful acquaintances throughout my time here with the WordPress project. And especially in my three years as the project&#8217;s Executive Director. You all have put a lot of trust in me and a lot of faith. And I know that we have gotten so much done together in the last few years. And I am equally sure that we&#8217;re going to get so much done in the years to come. And so thank you all so much for your continued work with WordPress and the way that you just bring your best at all times. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One other little thanks I want to give. Over the course of this year, I&#8217;ve had an excellent team that works with me on this podcast. I have editing and design folks and people who&#8217;ve joined me here and there, folks who helped me with my production. So big thank you to <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/dustinhartzler/\">Dustin</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/beafialho/\">Bea</a>, I realize your name is Beatriz in the actual credits, but I call you Bea, and so thank you. Also, a huge thank you to <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\">Chloé</a>, who does all of our production and wrangling every couple of weeks. A big round of applause and kudos to that tiny but tough team that helps me get this all done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s to go on top of the general thanks to the WordPress project. And if you all are celebrators, I hope you have a wonderful holiday season.

The hybrid event took place in New York City with a small audience (proof of vaccination required). As Matt said, &#8220;we had people join by plane, train, and automobile.&#8221; Those who didn’t make the trek to the live event watched the livestream from wherever they call home, all around the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was an exciting moment for the WordPress community which also celebrated its first in-person WordCamp in Sevilla, Spain, after a lengthy hiatus for in-person events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2021/12/15/matt-mullenweg-2021-state-of-the-word/\">view the full recording</a>, complete with captions and transcripts on WordPress.tv.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was thrilling to see so many meetup organizers host watch parties worldwide. Twenty-eight watch parties were held across eleven countries, with more than 300 RSVPs.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to past State of the Word events, Matt covered a broad range of topics. This year was no different. WordPress’ past, present, and future were in the spotlight, with highlights on the growth of the contributors, language translations, recent release milestones, and educational initiatives, to name a few.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Audience members and livestreamers alike viewed product demos showcasing upcoming features that will be the hallmark of WordPress 5.9, such as full site editing, block patterns, global styling options, and enhanced image controls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt took the opportunity to remind everyone of the WordPress roadmap which includes native multi-lingual support and real-time collaborative site editing. He also pointed out that anyone can contribute to WordPress’ progress through a number of different initiatives ranging from creating new features and testing to helping spread the word and educate others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt emphasized the way that open source software gets better by reminding everyone that “The more people that use a program like WordPress, the better it gets.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Broader topics covering the tech landscape including web3, merger and acquisition activity, as well as the growth and support of open source software, rounded out the energetic presentation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one-hour multimedia presentation was followed by an interactive <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2021/12/15/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2021-qa/\">question and answer</a> session where Matt fielded questions that were submitted ahead of the event, as well as questions from the livestream and studio audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discover everything that was covered by <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2021/12/15/matt-mullenweg-2021-state-of-the-word/\">watching the official event recording</a> and join the ongoing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ILoveWP\">#ILoveWP conversation on Twitter</a>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Special thanks to <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/dansoschin/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>dansoschin</a> for review and edits! </em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"11869\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20:\"WordPress 5.9 Beta 3\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/12/wordpress-5-9-beta-3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 20:19:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"5.9\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"beta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=11835\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"WordPress 5.9 Beta 3 is now available for testing.

It is one of the first managed hosts to offer a packaged product that handles all the dependencies and configuration required to launch a headless site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new add-on is called Atlas: Headless WP. It makes it easy for users to create  a site with a Node.js frontend that uses WP Engine&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/wpengine/faustjs\">Faust.js</a> headless framework for WordPress. It can be found inside the latest version of Local under the Add-ons menu. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The Atlas add-on watches any changes made to frontend code and compiles them after a file is saved. The add-on&#8217;s help docs have a guide to the folder structure for the headless sites it creates:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><code>app</code> – Contains the files of a typical WordPress site. Any changes made here will be reflected in the WordPress backend.</li><li><code>app-node</code> – The Javascript frontend which the Node.js process is watching and compiling.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The Atlas add-on gives users access to three blueprints that include starter code, plugins, content models, and page structure to jumpstart site development. One creates a barebones site with just the scaffolding necessary to get started. The <a href=\"https://ho9og0bwp1wgbx352zgxg3euj.js.wpenginepowered.com/\">second blueprint</a> is for a portfolio site and includes a blog and pages to list projects. The <a href=\"https://hmejg9kqfq27oh867on87bczn.js.wpenginepowered.com/\">third blueprint</a> appears to be very similar but just includes a blog and menu with no portfolio.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to note that Atlas can only be enabled on new sites in Local, as the app has no way to convert existing sites into a headless site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sites built using the add-on are supported in the import/export site workflows, but the company&#8217;s support team confirmed that Atlas sites can only be hosted at WP Engine. This is one of the chief drawbacks of the framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this reason, the Atlas add-on essentially functions sort of like a sales funnel for WP Engine, since sites produced using it are not portable to be hosted anywhere else. It does offer an easy way to experiment with headless WordPress to see how it all works together. It&#8217;s also convenient for WP Engine customers who want to use it to create new headless sites with less work setting up and configuring them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Atlas add-on for Local is still in beta, so it has a few rough edges. Users can get help for their support questions by creating a topic in the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://localwp.com/community/c/local-add-ons/atlas-headless-wp/31\" target=\"_blank\">Atlas: Headless WP</a> category of the community forums.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 04:26:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: A Look at Twenty Twenty-Two’s Upcoming Global Style Variations\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=133650\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://wptavern.com/a-look-at-twenty-twenty-twos-upcoming-global-style-variations\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4937:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">It is no secret that I have been <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/global-style-variations-skins-for-themes-have-landed-in-gutenberg\">excited about global style variations</a>. The upcoming feature will allow theme designers to bundle multiple design presets. In turn, end-users can cycle through them, selecting their preferred look without changing their active theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been writing about the feature <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/skins-are-back-in-style-proposal-for-themes-to-bundle-user-selectable-design-variations\">since November 2021</a>, holding out some hope that it was going to land with WordPress 5.9. It did not ship with that release, but I have eagerly followed every related ticket since, knowing it would eventually come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In January, the feature was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-12-5-introduces-global-styles-variations-preserves-adjacent-button-styling-and-adds-alpha-transparency-to-color-pickers\">merged into the Gutenberg plugin</a>. That almost feels like an eternity in &#8220;tech time.&#8221; With everything else happening in the current WordPress 6.0 release cycle, it is easy to forget that it will be a flagship feature in just a few short weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I am being honest, I feel like I have been waiting for this my entire career in the WordPress space. I think I have always known I have wanted it without always being able to verbalize it. I was an early adopter of child themes and began using them when they were a feature only available via a third-party plugin. WordPress always seemed to be missing something between an entire theme and a child that made sense for developers and users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many theme authors have tackled this in one way or another. Some would package skins that users could pick from. Others presented preset color and font combinations. However, these methods were never standardized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Global style variations are the answer I have been searching for. The system provides theme authors an easy way to bundle multiple variants without shipping them as separate child themes. Themers merely need to drop custom <code>*.json</code> files in their theme&#8217;s <code>/styles</code> folder. These appear in the Global Styles panel in the site editor for users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twenty Twenty-Two will officially be the first default theme to ship these style variants. The plan was to bundle six styles but was recently pared down to four (including the default). The following are screenshots of the three new variations expected to land in the next version of the theme:</p>\n\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<img />\nBlue, Pink, and Swiss variations for Twenty Twenty-Two\n\n\n\n<p>These could change as we get closer to the WordPress 6.0 release, but they are the latest iteration. For others who want to test them, they are <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/2440\">available via a pull request</a> on the WordPress Develop GitHub repository. They have not been merged into the core code yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I had to pick a favorite, it would be the Pink variation. It is not something I would typically select, but the IBM Plex Mono font works well with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a fan of shipping fewer variations for the initial set. As Kjell Reigstad <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55433#comment:8\">said on the associated Trac ticket</a>, it should &#8220;help folks differentiate them even more strongly.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Twenty Twenty-Two will be the first default theme to implement global style variations, other theme authors have already been offering some choices for users. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/alara/\">Alara</a> ships seven additional styles, and <a href=\"https://frostwp.com/download/\">Frost</a> has a Dark Mode variant. Users can already test these alongside the WordPress 6.0 beta or with WordPress 5.9 and the Gutenberg plugin installed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Variations are primarily being used as a quick way for end-users to choose a preset design. This is a one-off choice, but I envision a broader scope for the feature in the coming months and years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using Frost&#8217;s Dark Mode as an example, I could eventually see that being tied to the site visitor&#8217;s settings, showing the variation their preferred scheme. <em>If someone is not already working on a plugin for this, they should be.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another possibility is that some site owners may want to have seasonal or event-based design tweaks that are easy to switch between. <em>It would be fun to see WordPress release a Christmas-based Twenty Twenty-Two variation later this year.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors who want to start bundling their own style variations should <a href=\"https://fullsiteediting.com/lessons/global-style-variations/\">read Carolina Nymark&#8217;s tutorial</a>. It is one of the most up-to-date guides and covers everything needed to get started.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 02:41:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"Akismet: Version 4.2.3 of the Akismet WordPress Plugin is Now Available\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://blog.akismet.com/?p=2387\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"https://blog.akismet.com/2022/04/25/version-4-2-3-of-the-akismet-wordpress-plugin-is-now-available/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:632:\"<p>Version 4.2.3 of <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/\">the Akismet plugin for WordPress</a> is now available.

Today marks another important date into our project&#8217;s history: BuddyPress is <strong>progressively</strong> moving towards using the <strong><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/handbook/rewrite/\">WordPress Rewrite API</a></strong> to create, manage, parse and customize every URL generated by the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-3 wp-block-buttons\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-background\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-rewrites/\">Get BP Rewrites</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-324321\"></span>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>The challenge</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We are fully aware doing this move is a HUGE change. We&#8217;ve been thinking about it since April 25, 2013. For 9 years, we&#8217;ve been postponing the <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4954\">issue</a> for many good reasons. The most important one is: many plugin authors are building features on top of the BuddyPress plugin &amp; they got used to our Legacy URL parser: changing habits can be challenging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why we chose the &#8220;feature as a plugin&#8221; way to progress and achieve this important move for end users &amp; us all. The <a href=\"https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/tag/rewrites/\">BP Rewrites project</a> started on August 13, 2021. It used to be only available on our GitHub place as a start and we quickly understood, due to the <strong>lack of contributions</strong>, we needed to make it easier for everyone interested in BuddyPress to get involved. It&#8217;s now directly available from the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#finding-plugins-1\">Plugins/Add new</a> menu of your WordPress dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are around <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/buddypress/\">1,000 BuddyPress plugins</a> hosted on the official WordPress.org Plugin directory and <strong>we really need your contribution (yes even you who&#8217;s reading these lines) to help us make sure most of them will enjoy this great change</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We believe <strong>the BuddyPress community</strong> (the BuddyPress team, the BuddyPress contributors, the BuddyPress end users, the BuddyPress plugin &amp; theme developers) <strong>can meet this challenge</strong> if we all collaborate together:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>End users</strong> can download, test and <strong>warn</strong> plugin &amp; theme developers if they find the corresponding plugin or theme is not behaving the same with &amp; without BP Rewrites.</li><li><strong>Plugin &amp; Theme developers</strong> can <strong>adapt</strong> their piece of art, thanks to the end users warnings. They can also suggest contributors to improve the existing backward compatibility already in place and of course contribute themselves to the BP Rewrites plugin.</li><li><strong>Contributors</strong> can <strong>advise</strong> Plugin &amp; Theme developers about how to adapt or <strong>code</strong> the needed BP Rewrites adjustments if necessary. They can also <strong>start documenting</strong> how to write BuddyPress plugins and themes to fully enjoy BP Rewrites.</li><li>The <strong>team</strong>, thanks to all above contributions, will be able to <strong>take the right decisions</strong>.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Our end goal is to merge this feature into BuddyPress core. It will require us energy and time so that it finally happens the best for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>The benefits</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the BP Rewrites &#8220;feature as a plugin&#8221; you can already enjoy them <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f64c.png\" alt=\"🙌\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>From a end user’s point of view: BuddyPress can run with or without pretty URL and if they chose pretty URL, <strong>they can customize every URL generated by BuddyPress</strong> to make them even more meaningful for their community site members (eg: use words of their native language).</li><li>From a developer’s point of view: the BuddyPress way of creating, managing &amp; parsing URL should be faster, more reliable, extensible, testable and fully compliant with WordPress best practices.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>The risks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First, BP Rewrites is the way we chose to mitigate the risk of doing the BP Legacy URL Parser to the WP Rewrite API switch. The more we will be to test it, the more we&#8217;ll be able to eventually identify issues, fix them and improve the feature and the more reliable BuddyPress will be when the feature will be merged into its core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But end users may also wonder if it&#8217;s risky to test BP Rewrites for their community site. There&#8217;s always a risk when we choose to activate a plugin on a WordPress site. It&#8217;s always important to take a few seconds to prevent data alteration by first backing up your site&#8217;s database &amp; the <code>/wp-content</code> directory of your site. If things go wrong, you can simply use this backup to restore the previous state of your site. This precaution is not specific to the BP Rewrites plugin, you should always do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This being said, the BuddyPress team thinks the BP Rewrites is safe to test with BuddyPress 10.0 (or up). It&#8217;s easy to find back your community site the way it was by simply deactivating the plugin. The most serious damage that could happen is that you could lose the ability to edit the WordPress pages you defined as BuddyPress directory roots. In this case, you simply need to perform the page mapping once again from the &#8220;Pages&#8221; tab of the BuddyPress settings administration screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life.</p><cite><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali\">Muhammad Ali</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What BP Rewrites changes?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>FYI, once activated, The BP Rewrites plugin is editing the post type of the existing BuddyPress pages in favor of the&nbsp;<code>buddypress</code>&nbsp;post type. That’s why you don’t see the BuddyPress pages&nbsp;<s>anymore</s>&nbsp;(as long as the BP Rewrites plugin is active) into the corresponding WordPress Administration edit screen. The BuddyPress&nbsp;<strong>Pages</strong>&nbsp;settings screen is replaced by a BuddyPress&nbsp;<strong>URLs</strong>&nbsp;settings screen.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<a href=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2022/04/screenshot-1.png\"><img width=\"1018\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2022/04/screenshot-1-1018x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-324335\" /></a><em>The BuddyPress&nbsp;<strong>URLs</strong>&nbsp;settings screen</em></div>\n\n\n<p>This last screen is where you define custom slugs for the URL generated by BuddyPress. These slugs are saved as a post meta of the corresponding BuddyPress post type/page item. Then the BP Rewrites plugin is taking benefit from the BuddyPress hooks/APIs to change BP Core’s behavior.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you deactivate the plugin,&nbsp;<code>buddypress</code>&nbsp;post type’s items are switched back to regular pages and you get them back into the corresponding WordPress Administration edit screen. Post metas are still there in case you want to activate BP Rewrites back (this can happen when you’re testing another BuddyPress plugin). If you absolutely want to get rid of these post metas, you can delete the BuddyPress pages, create new ones and redo the page mapping from the BuddyPress Pages settings screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Many thanks to BP Rewrites first contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/oztaser/\">Adil Öztaşer (oztaser)</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/boonebgorges/\">Boone B Gorges (boonebgorges)</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/eha1\">Eric (eha1)</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/imath/\">Mathieu Viet (imath)</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/r-a-y/\">r-a-y</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/shanebp/\">shanebp</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Get BP Rewrites</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-7 wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-4 wp-block-column\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-5 wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-rewrites/\">BP Rewrites</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-6 wp-block-column\"></div>\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 24 Apr 2022 16:01:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Mathieu Viet\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"Gutenberg Times: Webfonts API, Accessibility Improvements, WordPress 6.0, and more – Weekend Edition 212\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=20986\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:110:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/webfonts-api-accessibility-improvements-wordpress-6-0-and-more-weekend-edition-212/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21147:\"<p>Howdy, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Greetings from the US again.

If you’ve tried it out, you’ll notice that it was released with a <code>beta</code> label on its menu to indicate it’s in an early stage and that it needs feedback from people like you to evolve it. As people have begun exploring, though, questions abound: Who is full site editing for? Why is it missing XYZ feature? Will it meet my needs? Why was it released now when it isn’t yet fully formed? This post seeks to clear up some of these questions and provide a wider context for this current stage of WordPress. &#8221; she wrote. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Just landed in Core:</strong> <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55513\">Allow registration of blocks containing scripts / styles that need to get enqueued from within a Theme</a> &#8211; After an interesting discussion during Developer Hours in March, <strong>Fabian Kägy</strong> and <strong>Grzegorz Ziółkowski</strong> collaborated to make it possible to register blocks in themes. It&#8217;s not the recommended way, as it leads to content lock in or content loss when themes are switched. Many agencies have advocated for the fix, so they can continue to provide all-in-one services, and reduce maintenance costs for themselves and their clients. It seems to be slated for WordPress 6.0. <strong>Milana Cap </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DjevaLoperka/status/1516076528076996609\">tweeted about it</a> and the reactions were mixed. <em><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/post-status-notes-495/\">Found on Post Status newsletter 495. </a></em> </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-w\">Webfonts API</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>Style Variations for Themes</em> is a signature feature coming with WordPress 6.0.

While not as popular as some of the other projects he has spearheaded, such as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/editorplus/\">Editor Plus</a>, he wanted to breathe some fresh life into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The original plugin allowed users to insert a slider block and create the slides directly from the post or page editor. The new approach is similar. However, end-users can only edit it from a new &#8220;Block Slider&#8221; post type.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Creating a slide in the block slider.\n\n\n\n<p>Existing users should note that the new version breaks compatibility with their old galleries. It would be wise to make a backup to revert to if necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kamal listed several benefits to the updated approach:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A clean and wider slide editing/creation interface. Comparatively, the &#8216;block&#8217; had less room to work with.</li><li>The fact we have a separate interface/post type, I took the opportunity to modify it a bit to make the slide creation easier for users.</li><li>This approach lets users create and manage sliders easily from one place (post type) compared to in-page block.</li><li>Using the slider to multiple pages/posts is easier with this approach.</li><li>The best part and the most important reason is that the slider can be used outside Gutenberg editor or anywhere with any page builder using the shortcode (or I could provide more ways to use it in the future).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the user, some of those can be advantages. However, for others, they are not. For example, not all websites would benefit from a dedicated slider management admin screen. Sometimes, a one-off slider is all that is wanted for something like the front page. The new approach creates more work and adds an unnecessary admin menu for those use cases. For users who add multiple sliders to their sites, it should simplify management.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kamal touts using the block shortcode anywhere, but this feels like a step back from the earlier version of the plugin. It is now impossible to see what a slider looks like mixed with page content without previewing it on the front end. When laying out a full-page design via the editor, having the live preview can be vital to putting it all together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I am working on a block that lets you insert a slider (and maybe do a bit more),&#8221; Kamal said when I questioned him on the implementation. &#8220;It should be out in the next update soon.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the user experience of creating and customizing sliders feels smooth. It is easy to attach new slides via the &#8220;Add Slide&#8221; button fixed to the bottom of the screen and navigate to others.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding multiple image slides.\n\n\n\n<p>Other than a minor spacing issue where the right navigation arrow butted against the side of the screen, I had no trouble using it. It worked well in the editor and on the front end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block Slider has a <a href=\"https://wpblockslider.com/\">commercial version</a> that begins at $29 per year. It includes updates and support for one site. There are also five-site and unlimited tiers for $49 and $99, respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, most users will likely not need the upgrade. Other than a handful of options, including a carousel view and a few customizations, most features are in the free version. And the plugin does not lack out-of-the-box options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If anything, the number of settings is almost dizzying. Users who want ultimate customizability should enjoy tinkering with the design tools. Those who prefer a scaled-back interface can always leave the defaults in place. Otherwise, diving into them can be overwhelming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kamal shared an intro video to the plugin that barely scratches the surface of what the plugin can do:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>I like where Kamal seems to be going with the plugin. His target audience focuses on users who love plenty of options and an easy way to manage their sliders. For one-off use cases, it is best to look elsewhere. Some bits still feel a little rough, like using a shortcode when placing the slider on a page, but that can always be addressed later.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-slider/\">WordPress Slider Plugin &#8211; Block Slider</a></blockquote>\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 23 Apr 2022 02:26:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:120:\"WPTavern: WordCamp US Trials New Program Connecting Underrepresented Speakers with Sponsors for Travel and Lodging Costs\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=133519\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:131:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-trials-new-program-connecting-underrepresented-speakers-with-sponsors-for-travel-and-lodging-costs\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3829:\"<p>WordCamp US, scheduled for September 9-11 in San Diego, is <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2022/support-underrepresented-speakers-at-wordcamp-us/\">trialing a new program</a> that would connect speakers from underrepresented groups with companies that agree to sponsor their travel and lodging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;To improve diverse representation at WordCamp US (WCUS), our Programming Team has looked into the barriers that hold different groups back, the largest of which is the cost of hotel and airfare/travel,&#8221; WCUS organizers wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;While WCUS can’t cover these costs, we can set up a connecting point between these speakers and companies that would like to support them.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordCamp is calling for interested companies to get in touch so they can be matched with speakers who need financial support. The companies will be responsible for setting the qualifications and managing the funds transfer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this month, in a post titled <a href=\"https://winstinahughes.com/reducing-barriers-to-the-full-inclusion-of-underrepresented-minority-speakers/\">Sponsor Inclusion in Tech</a>, WordPress contributor Winstina Hughes called the community to action, specifically to break down financial barriers to attending community events:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Underrepresented/minority groups in society frequently face disparities in income that limit their participation in personally valued activities beyond work activities that earn income. This is mirrored in the WordPress community when contributors forgo participation in community events due to income limitations. Participation in events requires a community member to personally pay for travel and lodging expenses or personally network for sponsorships to cover these expenses.</p><p>Transparently integrating travel and lodging sponsorships after a Call for Speakers submission selection would breakdown a notable barrier to inclusion that exists for many underrepresented/minority groups around the world – financial costs.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>MasterWP editor Rob Howard continued this conversation, referencing Hughes&#8217; call to action, in a recent <a href=\"https://masterwp.com/wordcamp-speakers-need-to-get-paid/\">post</a> that advocates for all speakers and organizers being paid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The largest and most obvious barrier to attending and speaking at WordCamp is money,&#8221; Howard said. &#8220;In order to offer a truly equal opportunity to everyone, the WordPress Foundation needs to set aside enough money to pay for the airfare and lodging of every speaker and organizer, period. Anything less than this privileges people who work for WordPress companies or people who have the disposable income for a random trip to San Diego.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Howard contends that this approach should not be a separate initiative but &#8220;should simply become how WordCamp works.&#8221; Yesterday MasterWP announced its own <a href=\"https://masterwp.com/wordcamp-us-2022-sponsorship/\">sponsorship program</a>. The team intends to sponsor at least six speakers and organizers to cover the costs of travel, meals, and lodging. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, Winstina Hughes worked with the WCUS speaker programming team to make speaker sponsorships a real possibility. Organizers will facilitate the connection between interested companies and selected speakers who are seeking sponsorship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp US has also <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2022/wordcamp-us-call-for-speakers-extended/\">extended its call for speakers</a>.

It was not something I had set out to do. I did not wake up one day and declare, &#8220;I think I will build a suite of custom block types over the next few days.&#8221; It just happened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first plugin I built was to address an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/32836\">old ticket for Gutenberg</a> that had not seen any traction. Perhaps others were not interested in the idea, or it never crossed their path in the sea of 1,000s of other tickets. <em>Why not just build it myself?</em> So, I did. It took a couple of hours, but much of that time was re-configuring the <code>@wordpress/scripts</code> build script to my liking and reading docs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that plugin out of the way, I started seeking new problems to solve. One that was already on my radar was the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/40264\">missing Comments Title block</a> necessary to bring the upcoming Comments Query Loop block to feature parity before WordPress 6.0 lands. So, I built a rough plugin for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Comments Title block in the site editor.\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, others took that initial idea and ran with it, building something far more flexible than my first attempt. Now, there is a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/40419\">new block in Gutenberg</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a couple of other itches I wanted to scratch, and there was little to do on a rain-filled Sunday. Namely, WordPress does not include equivalent blocks for the <code>wp_list_users()</code> and <code>wp_list_authors()</code> template tags. That seemed like an oversight, so I tackled early versions of those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will put these up for free on the official WordPress plugin directory soon for folks interested in them. I can only hope they will help someone else in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This post is about sharing my experience, the journey, rather than what became of it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, someone asked whether I could operate in this JavaScript-heavy world of blocks as a developer. It has been over two years since I took on a writing position here at WP Tavern and developed real-world solutions for users. I was only starting to use JavaScript with the block editor back then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, I have dabbled with block themes, even releasing one on WordPress.org. I have built a few PHP-based projects for fun in my spare time. I even created my first custom block plugin last summer and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/taking-the-leap-building-my-first-wordpress-block-plugin\">shared my experience with readers</a>. Shortly after, I built a second.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That burning flame I had nearly a year ago quickly died down. That had more to do with the state of block theme development, which was still in its infancy, than anything. I was excited about its potential, but consistent breakage was more than I had time to deal with, considering all of it was a fun side project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At heart, I am still a programmer, a problem solver. So, I began anew.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first stop was the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/javascript/js-build-setup/\">JavaScript Build Setup documentation</a> for building blocks. I was going to learn the &#8220;WordPress way&#8221; this time around. For the most part, I followed through with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only hiccup I had was the setup script snake-casing my namespace, <code>x3p0</code>, into <code>x_3_p_0</code> in function names. That was a mess to clean up. However, I did not need to go through that process in other block plugins. I just wanted the beginner experience on the first go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For building blocks, <code><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-scripts/\">@wordpress/scripts</a></code> is all that is necessary. I tinkered with it, added a couple of custom commands, and modified the input/output folders. However, it has everything needed to get up and running fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I skipped past the <em>Hola, mundo!</em> (Hello, world!) portion of the setup tutorial. Whenever I set out to build anything, I plan to dive headfirst into something a bit more complex. However, it never hurts to get the basics down to see how things work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My style of programming is one built upon failure. I venture out with an idea, fail miserably, and continue learning from my mistakes. A short while later, I had a custom block type that showed a link back to a nested comment&#8217;s parent:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Comment parent link block.\n\n\n\n<p>While that was a success, I have learned that some other built-in editor components might make it even better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That first block gave me a taste of modern development on WordPress. It was a relatively simple plugin to build, but it was easy to see how one could expand it out to more complex features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The components system has grown into a robust and flexible toolset for developers over these last few years. Plus, <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/components/\">the component-level documentation</a> is well-rounded at this point, especially when pairing it with usage in the core code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I continued building new blocks, I started taking on more complex concepts. One of the things I needed to learn was how to interact with the core data layer. As I stepped into my third and fourth block types, I needed to query users and list them:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Listing users via an Authors block.\n\n\n\n<p>While there is a <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/data-basics/\">&#8220;basics&#8221; tutorial</a> on working with core data, the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/data/data-core/\">reference guide</a> was spotty in places. Some pieces even seemed to be missing altogether. <em>Where were the advanced guides?</em> I could not find any, and &#8220;doing stuff&#8221; with data is the meat of plugin development when you get beyond a few simple form fields.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spent some time with the tried and true <code>console.log()</code> to figure out things and perused the core code. Eventually, I pushed through and built a couple of working projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Did my experience improve this time around compared to a year ago?</em> Without a doubt, it did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than anything, I want to thank all the contributors to the Gutenberg project. The build tools and range of pre-built components are welcome for this developer who has spent most of his time in the PHP world. I always enjoy being able to pick up a toolset and start building with it right away. I am sure I have only glimpsed some of what is possible at this point, but I look forward to trying new things. As I grow more comfortable, maybe I will write some of those advanced tutorials that I believe are missing.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 02:59:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"Post Status: WordPress Podcast and Video Picks for the Week of April 11\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=96253\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-podcast-and-video-picks-for-the-week-of-april-11/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3908:\"<div class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">Talk about #MentalHealth!

This week in WooCommerce functions we\'re looking at <code>get_variation_prices</code>. </p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">If you\'re a WooCommerce developer, variable products are always difficult to deal with. Manipulating them with code snippets or custom plugins is even tougher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today\'s core function (<code>get_variation_prices</code>) will definitely help you save time while working with prices, custom notices, conditional logic and such.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As usual, we\'ll study the function code, take a look at its usage, and finally analyze a case study that will come in useful sooner or later. Enjoy!</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-96369\"></span>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-function-code\">Function Code</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find <code>get_variation_prices under \\woocommerce\\includes\\class-wc-product-variable.php</code>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>/**\n * Get an array of all sale and regular prices from all variations. This is used for example when displaying the price range at variable product level or seeing if the variable product is on sale.\n *\n * @param  bool $for_display If true, prices will be adapted for display based on the `woocommerce_tax_display_shop` setting (including or excluding taxes).\n * @return array Array of RAW prices, regular prices, and sale prices with keys set to variation ID.\n */\n \npublic function get_variation_prices( $for_display = false ) {\n	$prices = $this-&gt;data_store-&gt;read_price_data( $this, $for_display );\n\n	foreach ( $prices as $price_key =&gt; $variation_prices ) {\n		$prices&#91; $price_key ] = $this-&gt;sort_variation_prices( $variation_prices );\n	}\n\n	return $prices;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>By reading the comments, we can see this function returns an <strong>array of prices for each variation</strong> for a product. This is handy — you don\'t need to loop over variations yourself!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also mentions a parameter, <code>$for_display</code>, which if set to &#8216;true\' can return prices according to the store\'s tax settings — including or excluding tax, based on whatever option you picked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the function code, we see two statements:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><code>read_price_data</code> clearly gets prices [regular, sale and display] from all variation IDs.</li><li><code>sort_variation_prices</code> is not so clear — but it sorts the returned array from lowest to greatest price. This is helpful when you need to get the min or the max value, for example, as you can just read the first or the last array values!</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>Function Usage</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As long as you have access to the <code>$product global</code> (in a product loop, on the single product page, in the admin, etc.), you can call <code>get_variation_prices</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the product must be a variable one, otherwise the function will return an empty array. (Or maybe an error, who knows? Post a comment if you want to send me some feedback about this.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be sure we\'re on the single product page and I\'m looking at a variable product, we can use the <code>woocommerce_before_variations_form</code> hook — evidently this triggers only there and then:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>add_action( \'woocommerce_before_variations_form\', \'bbloomer_get_variation_prices\' );\n\nfunction bbloomer_get_variation_prices() {\n	global $product;\n	echo \'&lt;pre&gt;\';\n	print_r( $product-&gt;get_variation_prices() );\n	echo \'&lt;/pre&gt;\';\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Result:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img width=\"752\" height=\"519\" src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-1-752x519.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-96370\" /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the grey box (preformatted text thanks to the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> HTML tag), we find the <code>get_variation_prices</code> output: <strong>a multidimensional array with 3 keys</strong> (<em>price, regular price, sale price</em>) <strong>and array values</strong> (<em>variation ID =&gt; price amount</em>) <strong>sorted by price amount</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Super handy!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lazy tip alert! You could even use <code>get_variation_prices</code> to simply get the variation IDs:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>$output = $product-&gt;get_variation_prices();\n$variation_ids = array_keys( $output&#91;\'price\'] );</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Printed output for $variation_ids:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img width=\"657\" height=\"258\" src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-96371\" /></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Case Study</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\'s wrap up with a practical example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Before</em> customers choose the variation from the attribute dropdown/s, it would be awesome to show a notice to display the most convenient offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We could look, for example, at the variation that has the biggest discount, and entice users to add it to cart today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have access to regular prices and sale prices.

A sampling of the upcoming major events include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>WordCamp Vienna, Austria (April 23, 2022)</li><li>WordCamp Irun (May 21–22, 2022)</li><li>WordCamp Europe (June 2–4, 2022)</li><li>WordCamp Warsaw, Poland (June 11–12, 2022)</li><li>WordCamp Montclair, (June 25, 2022)</li><li>WordCamp Netherlands (September 15–16, 2022)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress&#8217; Community Team published an <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2022/04/21/announcement-updated-covid-19-guidelines-for-official-wordpress-events/\">updated set of COVID-19 guidelines</a> today ahead of a the five WordCamps that will be happening over the next few months. There are a few notable changes from the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-team-updates-covid-19-safety-guidelines-to-relieve-volunteers-of-enforcement-burden\">previous guidelines</a>, which mandated that organizers select a venue with staff that can check temperatures and vaccination status and remind attendees to wear masks. This removed the enforcement burden from volunteers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The updated guidelines require organizers follow local guidelines, provide masks and hand sanitizer, and provide a sticker to attendees that indicates if they prefer others to wear a mask when conversing in close proximity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Community Team strongly recommended the following for attendees:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>We still recommend that you wear a mask while at in-person WordPress events.</li><li>If you see that someone is wearing a sticker requesting people wear a mask near them, please wear a mask while within 6 feet (2 meters) of them or keep your distance.</li><li>A request that you only attend in-person if you are vaccinated or have recently tested negative.</li><li>Please stay at home if you are sick or have recently come in contact with someone who is ill.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Ten days prior to publishing the updated guidelines, the Community Team requested feedback in a post that asked the question, &#8220;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2022/04/11/return-to-in-person-events-share-your-challenges/\">What is keeping you from either organizing or attending an in-person event?</a>&#8220;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Birmingham organizer Ryan Marks responded, saying his team was restricted from organizing in-person events (under the previous guidelines). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My location doesn’t allow for the checking of vaccination status,&#8221; Marks said. &#8220;So we must answer yes to all of the In-person safety checklist items. It hasn’t been possible to answer yes to the first two questions yet.&#8221; The checklist required the area’s average positive case rate to average under 4% for 28 days, and to have under 50 new cases reported per 100,000 people for 14 days, among other requirements. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marks and his team were forced to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-birmingham-postponed-due-to-rising-local-covid-19-infection-rates\">postpone WordCamp Birmingham</a> in January after Omicron hit Alabama and local infections began rising. The camp had previously been criticized for its initial <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220105003454/https://birmingham.wordcamp.org/2022/faq/\">masking policy</a>, which stated “Masks are required for entry and preferred throughout the event.&#8221; This set off heated discussions on social media, where concerned community members <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mor10/status/1478790408482164737\">condemned the gathering as “irresponsible.&#8221;</a> The camp revised its masking guidelines to require masks indoors but ultimately had to postpone due to local conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The updated guidelines from WordPress&#8217; Community Team bear a striking similarity to WordCamp Birmingham&#8217;s original masking policy &#8211; if the local authorities do not have requirements in place, masks are optional but recommended.  It has been <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/masking-science-sars-cov2.html\">well-documented</a> that indoor masking can significantly reduce transmission, so the Community Team must have witnessed a major change in pandemic conditions to amend the guidelines to make them optional. With the exception of a handful of flagship events, WordPress has ultimately decided to leave the requirements to local authorities. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As flagship events are larger and draw an international crowd, both WordCamp Europe and WordCamp US organizers were asked to view these as minimum requirements and are expected to have a more comprehensive plan in place,&#8221; WordPress community organizer Angela Jin said in today&#8217;s announcement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Europe will require masks indoors and social distancing at the speakers dinner. They are creating self-service registration booths and trying to put more activities, like WP Cafe, outdoors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp US will be following San Diego&#8217;s local guidelines in September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We will require all attendees to be vaccinated or have recently tested negative,&#8221; Jin said. &#8220;Additionally, due to the size and nature of this event, masks will be required to be worn over both the mouth and nose while indoors. Hand sanitizer and masks will also be available and some activities, such as lunch, will be outdoors.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 21:16:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"Do The Woo Community: Build Your Developer Network, Career and Business\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=71280\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://dothewoo.io/build-your-developer-network-career-and-business/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:421:\"<p>Whether you are looking to grow or change your WordPress or WooCommerce development career, here are some tips from Marcus and Courtney.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/build-your-developer-network-career-and-business/\">Build Your Developer Network, Career and Business</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 09:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: A Pared Back Web Fonts API May Land in WordPress 6.0 or Not at All\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=133397\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"https://wptavern.com/a-pared-back-web-fonts-api-may-land-in-wordpress-6-0-or-not-at-all\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5700:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Anyone who has been watching or participating in the development of the web fonts API can attest that it has been an emotional rollercoaster. At one point, it seemed to be a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/a-web-font-api-possibly-coming-to-wordpress\">shoo-in for WordPress 5.9</a>. Then, it was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/proposed-web-fonts-api-not-coming-to-wordpress-5-9-possibly-landing-in-gutenberg-first\">punted to the next release</a>. Sure that it was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-web-fonts-api-has-arrived\">landing once again</a>, we find ourselves looking down the track, wondering just where the next dip or twist will take us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the weekend, I had a sense of dread. The WordPress 6.0 Beta 1 release last week felt premature. I am just as excited about the next major update as I have been about any before. There are tons of noteworthy features. It is OK for some of them to not be polished for a beta release, but the problem was the list of incomplete and missing pieces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision to postpone the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/24952\">Post Author Name block</a> left me scratching my head. It is an obvious pairing for the new Post Author Biography block and almost feels necessary for Author Template support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Comments Query Loop block, a replacement for Post Comments, was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-comment-related-blocks-arriving-with-wordpress-6-0\">missing vital features</a>. Fortunately, most of those seemed squared away now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, there was the web fonts API. I had not paid it much attention since its inclusion in <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-12-8-launches-the-web-fonts-api-improves-group-nesting-and-adds-keyboard-shortcut-for-links\">Gutenberg 12.8</a> over a month ago. I was happy to see it merged and have used it ever since. However, there has been some trouble brewing that might spoil its inclusion in the 6.0 release. It was notably missing from the first beta, and there was no final decision on its status as Beta 2 rolled out yesterday. There are still several open, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%5BPriority%5D+High%22+label%3A%22%5BFeature%5D+Webfonts%22+\">high-priority tickets</a> for the API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of the problematic features was tied to other highlights of the upcoming 6.0 release, and the web fonts API is intrinsically linked to what is, arguably, the <em>crème de la crème</em> of the bunch: <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/global-style-variations-skins-for-themes-have-landed-in-gutenberg\">global style variations</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First touted before the release of WordPress 5.9 and its accompanying default theme, global style variations would allow end-users to switch between pre-built &#8220;skins.&#8221; Twenty Twenty-Two would showcase the feature in all its wonder:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Potential variations on Twenty Twenty-Two.\n\n\n\n<p>However, the feature did not make the cut. That was OK because the web fonts API did not squeeze in either. These variations would allow theme authors to mix and match different colors, block styles, and fonts. Like a PB&amp;J without the J, the global style variations feature is a fine meal in its own right, but fonts offer a variety of flavors that users deserve to taste. If we wait for some future release toward the end of the year, Twenty Twenty-Two might feel like old news by then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After WordPress 6.0 Beta 2&#8217;s release, it has become crunch time for this long-awaited feature that standardizes how fonts are loaded in WordPress. One truth is almost set in stone: the complete API will be deferred to a future release. However, there is a sliver of hope for theme authors that a <code>theme.json</code>-only version will be available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya Mork has opened a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/40472\">ticket for paring down the feature</a> to disallow programmatically registering and enqueueing fonts. Along with work by Ari Stathopoulos, the associated <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/40493\">pull request on GitHub</a> would still allow theme authors to define custom font-faces via <code>theme.json</code> and custom <code>/styles/*.json</code> files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a compromise on a robust API that many have been waiting for, but it is necessary. Yet, there are still no guarantees, and the patch needs testing from theme authors sooner rather than later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As much as I want the web fonts API to land in 6.0, I would be remiss to not point out that April 12, the release date of Beta 1, was the &#8220;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/03/11/wordpress-6-0-planning-update/\">effective feature freeze.</a>&#8221; Essentially, this is the deadline for new features for the release cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having these deadlines in place is not arbitrary. They give time for users to test and report bugs. They allow theme and plugin developers to make sure their extensions are working. When new features start landing in Beta 3 and Release Candidates, it can sometimes be a mad scramble to catch up in an already fast-paced cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At a certain point, WordPress must abide by its own rules. Otherwise, it feels like some pet features get a pass where others might not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The web fonts API is one of those things I would not mind breaking the rules for. My only argument is that it is such an integral piece of global style variations that I cannot imagine having one and not the other. Derailing this now will set a lot of possible theme advancements back for months as developers wait for the 6.1 release.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 03:18:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WPTavern: DuckDuckGo and Brave Move to Bypass Google AMP Pages by Default\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=133399\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"https://wptavern.com/duckduckgo-and-brave-move-to-bypass-google-amp-pages-by-default\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5262:\"<p>Yesterday both DuckDuckGo and the Brave browser announced they will be bypassing Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) in favor of serving publishers&#8217; content on the original URL.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brave is calling the new feature &#8220;<a href=\"https://brave.com/privacy-updates/18-de-amp/\">De-AMP</a>.&#8221; In cases where it&#8217;s not possible to rewrite the URLS, the browser will watch as pages are fetched and redirect users, while preventing AMP code from being loaded and executed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;AMP harms users&#8217; privacy, security and internet experience, and just as bad, AMP helps Google further monopolize and control the direction of the Web,&#8221; Brave Privacy engineer Shivan Sahib said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brave is also working on a &#8220;<a href=\"https://brave.com/privacy-updates/11-debouncing/\">debouncing</a>&#8221; feature to protect its users against bounce tracking.

The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/publishers-move-to-abandon-google-supported-mobile-web-initiative-11645725640\">reports</a> that Vox Media LLC (Verge, Vox and New York Magazine), Buzzfeed&#8217;s Complex Networks (Complex and Sole Collector), and BDG (parent company of  Bustle, Gawker, Nylon and W.), have all begun testing or considering leaving AMP in favor of their own mobile-optimized pages. The Washington Post abandoned AMP in 2021. The publications&#8217; executives anticipate that leaving AMP will give them more control over their mobile pages, ad formats, better prices for their ad space, and a better chance for paywalled sites to grow their subscriber bases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Media executives now have a clearer picture of how Google intends to benefit from AMP after the DOJ&#8217;s unredacted complaint <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/amp-has-irreparably-damaged-publishers-trust-in-google-led-initiatives\">revealed that AMP pages brought 40% less revenue to publishers</a>. The December 2020 lawsuit referenced internal documents obtained from Google showing that AMP&#8217;s speed benefits “were also at least partly a result of Google’s throttling. Google throttles the load time of non-AMP ads by giving them artificial one-second delays in order to give Google AMP a ‘nice comparative boost.‘”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the wake of these revelations, and AMP no longer being required for the Top Stories carousel, publishers who adopted AMP, often at an enormous cost to themselves, are venturing out to see if they can better monetize their sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are one of the 500,000+ publishers who have invested in using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/\">official AMP plugin for WordPress</a>, it&#8217;s important to know that not all visitors will see AMP pages. The plugin&#8217;s Standard mode has only one theme that serves requests to a single AMP version of the website. As anti-AMP sentiment grows, and more apps, browsers, search engines, and users adopt ways to block or bypass AMP pages, it will become increasingly more important to maintain the non-AMP version of a website alongside the AMP version. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 00:48:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"Post Status: Post Status Excerpt (No. 55) —A New Era of WordPress Themes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=95876\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"https://poststatus.com/post-status-excerpt-no-55-a-new-era-of-wordpress-themes/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4366:\"<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“A style is the design language for a theme.”  </p><cite>— Rich Tabor</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">In this episode, David Bisset talks with someone who has moved the WordPress theme needle a long way: <strong>Rich Tabor</strong>. Rich believes the arrival of the  <strong>Full Site Editing</strong> experience in <strong>WordPress 5.9</strong> is the biggest innovation since themes emerged. Speaking from the experience of creating blocks and block themes, Rich explains how Full Site Editing will change WordPress\'s identity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> WordPress professionals need to be familiar with more than just just &#8220;blocks.&#8221; There are block themes, styles, and more features that have already arrived in the WordPress editor. This episode helps put these new enhancements in context for builders, agencies, and creatives.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\">Every week <strong><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/podcast/the-excerpt/\">Post Status Excerpt</a></strong> will bring you important news and insights from guests working in the WordPress space. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f399.png\" alt=\"🎙\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><br /><br />You can listen to <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/podcast/the-excerpt/\">past episodes</a> of <strong>The Excerpt</strong>, <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/post-status-podcasts/\">browse all our podcasts</a>, and don’t forget to subscribe on <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/1m3xwXbe0MG5BzFVPtB0A7\">Spotify</a>, Amazon Music, <a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS8ySkU5c2M4UA\">Google Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://castro.fm/podcast/c53552c6-1ee0-4fc4-9de4-08ed6bf1ee4d\">Castro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/PostStatus\">YouTube</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"https://player.fm/series/wordpress-post-status-podcasts\">Player.fm</a>, <a href=\"https://pca.st/05rR\">Pocket Casts</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress-post-status-draft-podcast.simplecast.com/\">Simplecast</a>, or by <a href=\"https://feeds.simplecast.com/2JE9sc8P\">RSS</a>. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f3a7.png\" alt=\"🎧\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-mentioned-in-the-show\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f517.png\" alt=\"🔗\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Mentioned in the show:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://richtabor.com/a-new-era/\">A new era of WordPress themes is finally here</a></li><li><a href=\"https://richtabor.com/blocks-on-github/\">All my blocks are now available on Github</a></li><li><a href=\"https://richtabor.com/wabi/\">Meet Wabi, a WordPress block theme for writers and publishers</a></li><li><a href=\"https://richtabor.com/generative-art/\">Building a Generative Art Gallery with P5.js</a></li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/richard_tabor\">Richard Tabor</a> (Twitter)</li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/dimensionmedia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">David Bisset</a> (Twitter)</li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Post Status</a> (Twitter)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator logo is-style-default\" />\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"sponsor-bluehost\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f64f.png\" alt=\"🙏\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Sponsor: <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-vip\">WordPress</a><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/bluehost\"> VIP</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Founded in 2006, WordPress VIP is <em>the</em> agile <a href=\"https://wpvip.com/enterprise-content-management-system/\">content platform</a> that empowers marketers to build content both faster and smarter so they can drive more growth.

Head over to WP tavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox and use the contact form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Cate DeRosia. Cate is a familiar face in the WordPress community. Along with her husband Topher they run the HeroPress Network, which aims to make it easy to find any and all WordPress related content. She describes herself as a serial volunteer in the community. In early 2022, KCate was hired by Automattic to be a sponsored member of the community team. And it&#8217;s this role, which finds her on the podcast today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In-person events have been largely non-existent for the last two years. Many events have moved online and tried to keep the momentum going. But for some, it&#8217;s just not the same. In-person events, bring something unique to the table. There&#8217;s something special about interacting, face-to-face, sharing ideas and friendship in a way that&#8217;s virtually impossible on a screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years ago, if you were attending a WordPress meetup or WordCamp, it&#8217;s likely that you didn&#8217;t think too much about your safety at the event. You showed up, enjoyed the presentations and social spaces, and then went home. But now we&#8217;re all changed. Now both attendees and organizers need to make sure that the events are safe. That they are following local guidelines and have thought through all the consequences of gathering many people in one space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a lot to take on, but at the same time, it&#8217;s a golden opportunity to imagine afresh what a WordCamp might be. Cate wants to make this moment count, and she needs your help. Your ideas. On the podcast today, we talk about her blue sky thinking post, which is a forum for people to engage with her and her team, so that events can be made different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What does the community of 2022 want from WordPress events? Are we happy with how things have always been done or do we want something new, something different? Cate talks about how your opinions are being gathered and how they can shape the future of WordPress events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all the links in the show notes by heading over to WP tavern.com forward slash podcast. Where you&#8217;ll also find all the other podcast episodes. And so, without further delay, I bring you Cate DeRosia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Cate DeRosia Hello Cate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:56] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> Hello, Nathan. It&#8217;s so nice to talk with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And you too. Typically at the beginning of the podcast, just to give a bit of orientation we ask people to tell the listeners who they are and what their relationship is with WordPress. So I&#8217;m going to do the same thing. If you don&#8217;t mind Cate, just tell us a little bit about you and how it is that you&#8217;re appearing on a WordPress podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:16] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> That is a really excellent question. So I&#8217;ve been a serial volunteer in the community since about 2015. I really dove in deep there. I was transitioning away from homeschooling the girls to whatever I was going to do next with my life. My husband&#8217;s a veteran developer and had kind of made his home in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it made sense for me, I have an English degree. I really love the soft side of business communications and community. And that was kind of lacking in WordPress at the time. And so I started looking around at things you could do, jobs you could have in WordPress that didn&#8217;t involve development or design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was, it&#8217;s been a pretty interesting journey in kind of, invigorating for other people who have been in the community for a while and are looking for a change maybe. I&#8217;ve done a lot of freelance writing some community engagement, and then recently as of January, I was hired by Automattic to be a sponsored member of the community team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I couldn&#8217;t be more thrilled with that position. It really sets me up nicely to help the community. I&#8217;m also part of the Heropress project, which has been growing by leaps and bounds lately. We moved from our inspirational essays to a whole network of other services for the community, basically. So I&#8217;ve been very, very active for quite a while on the community side of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think if it&#8217;s okay with you before we get into the main event of the podcast, the discussion that we&#8217;re going to have, I&#8217;d really be interested to know what the role that you&#8217;ve taken on at Automattic, what that involves. You said that it was community focused, but you able to just give us some kind of insight into the kind of thing that you are doing on a day-to-day basis to help swell and build that community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:56] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> Yeah, I&#8217;m really glad you asked because it&#8217;s a hidden job in a way. Aside from the fact that my benefits and paycheck come from Automattic, I don&#8217;t work for Automattic. I work exclusively for the WordPress community through.org. I&#8217;m on a team of eight, which actually just doubled. So at the beginning of the year, we brought on four new team members, including myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We handle all of the paperwork behind having an event. So all of the finances for WordCamps, every WordCamp comes through us. We vet organizers for both meetups and WordCamps. And we have these do action events, to make sure that they represent the WordPress community. That they&#8217;re somebody that you would feel comfortable having your work behind. We also then have room in our time, in our days to work on a variety of projects that are important to us. I&#8217;m currently one of the lead trio for WordCamp US, and I&#8217;m doing a lot of work in kind of reactivating our blogs, which is why we&#8217;re talking today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m starting to use them more to create conversations with the community. To kind of bridge a gap that&#8217;s always been there. To help the community feel a little more, heard to give them an opportunity to share their opinions a little bit more. Others on my team are working with Jill Binder&#8217;s WP Diversity initiative, and bringing that more fully into the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another one is highly active in translations and helping to get WordPress out in languages as possible. And then a fourth member of my team is excellent at documentation. And she&#8217;s been really going in and making it easier for people who want to organize an event to come on board and do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That gives us a really perfect insight into why you&#8217;re talking today because the subject under discussion really is about the re-introduction of WordPress live events. Now I don&#8217;t suppose anybody needs to be told why we haven&#8217;t had live events for the last period of time. We haven&#8217;t. Several years have gone past, but it looks, at the time of recording, which is in April, 2022, it looks as if the world is settling down and considering going back to in-person events. And so that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to be talking about today. We&#8217;re going to be talking about some of the questions Cate is posing to the community, and ways that you can help answer those questions and give Cate and her team insights into what the future of WordPress events might look like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just before we get into that, just wondering if you could illustrate for us what it is that you think the world has been missing over the last couple of years. We know that we did our best. We went online and probably of any community on the planet, we were able to make that pivot. We had the technology and the websites and the infrastructure, good to go. But nevertheless, after a couple of years, I think it&#8217;s fair to say that people, given the chance, many of them would prefer to go back to real world events. And I&#8217;m just wondering, perhaps we could take this in the broad sweep, any ideas that you&#8217;ve had from friends, but maybe it&#8217;s a personal story. What do you think we&#8217;ve been missing ever since in-person events got pulled?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:03] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> You know, I love that question and it&#8217;s been on my mind since Topher and I had the opportunity to go to The State of the Word, in New York for HeroPress. Backing up a little bit, if there hadn&#8217;t been online events when I was getting started in WordPress, I would have had a really hard time getting started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was still being a full-time mom. I didn&#8217;t have a job, so I didn&#8217;t have a budget for travel. We were always a single income family, so there wasn&#8217;t extra money for anything. And so if I hadn&#8217;t been able to attend some things virtually, I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to learn as much as I did and have the start that I had.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s an introvert myself, that always seemed like a good fit. You know, I liked having online events where I could just listen and learn from. But as we&#8217;ve gone through the pandemic and the real isolation that comes from being really cut off from people, you start to see how important it is to be able to see somebody&#8217;s face when you&#8217;re talking to them. A lot of trust is built in the non-verbals, and so it matters a lot to be able to sit down across from somebody and see what they&#8217;re really saying, not just the words that are coming out of their mouth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But even beyond that, I was thinking about like, why did we go to New York? There are 50 of us that went there for the State of the Word, because I could sit at home and watch the State of the Word. I didn&#8217;t have to fly. I didn&#8217;t have to risk my health. You know, I didn&#8217;t have to do that. And I realized that it&#8217;s not the event itself, and you hear this a lot. The hallway track is the, you know, the thing everybody loves about a WordCamp. But why? And it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s a place where the other things get discussed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you&#8217;re sitting around a table with somebody and you&#8217;ve been there for an hour. You moved away from the conference talk completely, and have started brainstorming. You&#8217;ve started looking at your business from a different perspective. You&#8217;re thinking about community from a different perspective. There&#8217;s conversations flowing around you and you pick up these little bits and pieces that you don&#8217;t even know you&#8217;re going to use, but eventually down the road, you&#8217;re like, oh, Hey, I remember this person&#8217;s good at that thing, because I heard them talking about it over here. And it wasn&#8217;t even a conversation you were involved in and sometimes it completely revolutionizes your life. And so it&#8217;s never one thing that makes in-person events so important, but it&#8217;s like those little tiny bits and pieces of things that you can&#8217;t get unless you&#8217;re in a relaxed environment where you can just talk to each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s a really interesting insight because many people might think that the sessions themselves are the thing. Many people clearly talk about the hallway track and, maybe people are talking about the after party and things like that, but the whole range of different things going on, and, I&#8217;ve heard that same emotion, that same idea expressed by several people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s the thousands of little, small interactions that occur in unexpected places when you&#8217;re just wandering around the corridors that seem to make great big difference. You described a minute ago that you were not in a position at the beginning of your WordPress journey to go to the real events. And so obviously you were happy with the online events. Have you had any experiences more recently where you&#8217;ve become a little bit fatigued by those?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you still attend them with the same alacrity that you used to, or do you find yourself perhaps not attending as much because it&#8217;s become a little bit, how should we say, a little bit tired and it&#8217;s the same thing potentially over and over again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:35] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> Yeah. So I would say that in the last two years, I have attended one online event and it wasn&#8217;t any of the ones I organized. I was online for both WordFests, through both of them. But the only WordCamp event I attended was the one where my girls played, they did some music for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And part of it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve reached a spot where I do go to events purely to meet people. And it&#8217;s really a challenge online. But also you know, when you sit in front of your computer all day and then want to go to an event on a weekend that involves sitting in front of your computer, again, it doesn&#8217;t have the same change of life that going to an in-person event has. It&#8217;s just exhausting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, good point, and I&#8217;m sure one that many people can identify with. So we&#8217;re going to change gears a little bit, and we&#8217;re going to introduce a post that Cate wrote on the 23rd of March. It&#8217;s called return to in-person events, blue sky thinking. You can find it on the make.wordpress.org channel, but for simplicity sake, just go to the post associated with this and I&#8217;ll put the link in there, and you can find it from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the intention of this is you would like to offer up a brainstorming opportunity to people, so that in the future, we&#8217;ve got some fresh ideas about how WordCamps and other WordPress meetups and so on might look. And it&#8217;s kind of based on the fact that, according to people such as yourself, I know you&#8217;ve recently written a more recent posts, which again, I&#8217;ll link to in the show notes, but there&#8217;s a piece of linked in the article from Andrea Middleton, in which she emphasizes that we probably are different as a species for want of a better word. We have been changed entirely by the last couple of years. And so if that is the case and we&#8217;ve got different expectations and we&#8217;ve got different, maybe we&#8217;ve got different concerns about the kind of situations we&#8217;re willing to put ourselves in, then we need to rethink what a WordCamp might look like. We could put the old WordCamp back together, but perhaps this is a fantastic opportunity to rejig it a little bit. Have I summarize that correctly or did I miss the target or perhaps just left something out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:01] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> I am delighted to say that you got it pretty much exactly, like what we&#8217;re looking for. So the community team is made up of community organizers. And so we have our own reasons, I&#8217;m a meetup organizer, as well as part of the organizing team for WordCamp US. I know what&#8217;s keeping me from organizing WordCamps. We&#8217;re not doing a local WordCamp this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And our meetup hasn&#8217;t started meeting a person again, even though our community&#8217;s fairly healthy and low on COVID at the moment. So I know what my reasons are, but that&#8217;s very limiting, you know, we don&#8217;t want to operate off of just what we know. We want to open it up to hear what other people know too. The reason that I did two posts, the first one is a brainstorming post. If you&#8217;re an organizer and you have ideas on how to restart your event, or how do you know how somebody could restart their event, please put them down, even if you touch more on pain points than actual answers, we want to hear what you&#8217;re thinking and where you&#8217;re hurting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other post is purely for pain points and open to the entire community. Both posts have the same goal of getting more people talking about the topic. Cause we&#8217;re just, we&#8217;re so much richer together. The ideas that I have can be good ideas, but they&#8217;re still limited by my experience and my perception. Other people, and you can see from the list of answers, like there are no two answers that are the same on the posts so far. And it&#8217;s just great to see the directions people approach the question from, and the ideas that they throw out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> This I think is the first podcast episode that I&#8217;ve done for WP Tavern where there really is an actual call to action, because I think the nature of this episode is that we&#8217;re hoping, if anybody is thinking about running an event or they have an opinion on how events should be in the future, we are encouraging you to find the link in the show notes and go to Cate&#8217;s posts and give her some feedback, because as we&#8217;ve just both said, the world has changed and we want to take this opportunity. It&#8217;s almost like phoenix from the flames kind of thing. Isn&#8217;t it? You know, we&#8217;ve got this opportunity to revitalize and build from the ground up. Whilst you were talking just then I was going through in my mind some of the friends that I have in the real world and some of the differences that I&#8217;ve noticed in them over the last two years. And it may be in the case of some people that I know that they are now less likely to leave their own home. You know, they try to do everything in a much more confined way. They leave and try to achieve four things in one outing from the house, as opposed to one outing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have other friends who are just desperate everything, to return to normal and be able to throw all of the, all of the restrictions and everything over their shoulder and leave this whole thing behind. And there are other people who may be somewhere in the middle, you know, they&#8217;ve got a cautionary approach and some things they want to be mindful of and other things not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it&#8217;s with that opinion that we&#8217;re going into this, and you&#8217;ve got three goals. It would be silly if I said what they were, maybe it&#8217;s best if I hand that to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:52] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> Yeah we want the meetup organizers to feel supported, because we all know that even though we&#8217;re coming out of COVID, I&#8217;m exhausted. I mean I&#8217;ve been trying to keep a family safe. Running a business and all the other things that happen, you know, we&#8217;re all tired if nothing else. And so meetup organizers are, to ask them to do one more thing, we&#8217;re looking to ease that as best we can. But like you said, the people that we&#8217;re trying to help, they&#8217;re different. They&#8217;re reasonably scared. They&#8217;re nervous about being back out around people. Maybe they&#8217;ve got particular health reasons that make it more challenging. So we need to be supporting the organizers as well as the attendees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And hopefully through brainstorming with the community, which is the third point, we can come up with some new and creative ways to make this easier for everybody. But if we don&#8217;t like, if the organizers don&#8217;t feel supported and the attendees don&#8217;t feel safe, then nobody&#8217;s going to come back together again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The purpose of this is that you want ideas and let&#8217;s go through a few of the different ideas that we&#8217;ve had so far. The ideas are being shared in the form of comments at the bottom of the posts in a sort of typical WordPress fashion. Do you just want to go through a few of the pieces that you&#8217;ve picked up on that were quite interesting?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the idea here is I guess to illustrate that, as you said, none of them are the same. Everybody seems to have a different expectation of what they would like to change. And some of them were really curious to me as I read through them. I genuinely thought that never would have occurred to me. So let&#8217;s just share, go through a few of those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:25] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> Sure. Yeah. You know, we&#8217;ve been talking more and more about diversity in the community and well, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily fit, it may not have been something we had on our mind when this post came out. Hearing other people talk about how adding diversity options to our meetups can help people feel more safe and comfortable, that definitely is right on topic. And so it wasn&#8217;t a direction we expected anybody to come from, but we&#8217;re really happy to get that feedback from them. Another post talks about reusing talks that have happened at other WordCamps or at other meetups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our meetup is small here in Grand Rapids, and we started before the pandemic bringing in virtual speakers because that, not that we didn&#8217;t have speakers who were willing, but it was kind of always the same people feeling like they had to speak. And so to bring more diversity, more variety to our topics, we started bringing in the virtual speakers and you can do that over prerecorded talk from somebody else or from a different WordCamp. And so those are the kinds of ideas, like looking at content that we already have, that we can reuse. I&#8217;m talking about, what resources can we provide if they can make this easier for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, you mentioned diversity. Somebody mentioned the idea that maybe going forwards, it would be a good idea to not have a single individual in charge of any event no matter how small or large it might be. The idea of teaming up with people, that speaks very much to the, you know, you&#8217;ve said earlier that you were exhausted off the back of this, maybe spreading that load slightly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how don&#8217;t know how easy that is I&#8217;m not entirely sure what the sense of wishing to be an organizer is these days. I don&#8217;t know if the desire to organize these kinds of events has gone down because of the pandemic or there&#8217;s more people trying to get involved in there, but I do also like the idea of the one that you just shared in terms of people reusing content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That just strikes me as such a sensible idea. If somebody over in on Australian meetup has created a piece of content and it&#8217;s already there and it&#8217;s perfectly usable. In fact, it might be utterly brilliant. Why not just repurpose it and have it say in Birmingham or Manchester or Los Angeles or wherever it might be. And in that way, we can share that content rather than it being viewed by the 40 people who showed up to that event on that particular date and time. That&#8217;s a really powerful one I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:43] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> Yeah, exactly. The initial one you shared goes back to something that you mentioned earlier, but we&#8217;re really looking at rethinking how meetups are structured. And in reality, I think it&#8217;s more of a communicating with the community about how meetups are intended to be structured.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They aren&#8217;t necessarily supposed to have a single organizer. They&#8217;ve kind of fallen into, I don&#8217;t want to say a rut, but kind of a pattern of you have a meetup and it has a speaker and you know, and that&#8217;s what that month is like. When in reality any person in the meetup can organize an event that can just be coffee or coworking. And so we have plans in the works to start reminding people that there are other alternatives to what a meetup can look like or who can organize an event. And we&#8217;re hoping that will help with growing co-organizers, which is another response on the post as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then also move into the idea of repurposing content or like using some of the new Learn content that&#8217;s been coming out, that&#8217;s structured nicely for meetups, but just getting some new ideas on what a meetup needs to look like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There seems to be a concern in some of them, although it&#8217;s not explicitly stated, it&#8217;s kind of implied in a few of the comments that you&#8217;ve got, that there&#8217;s concern around the size of the audience and the size of the pool of people who are going to be willing to do events in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I just wonder, do you have concerns about that? Do you have concerns that in the future, these events are going to reopen only to find that less people are getting there. If that&#8217;s the case, and that is something we need to worry about because people have got into the habit of not attending, or maybe they&#8217;re just new to the community over the last couple of years, and they simply don&#8217;t know that these things ever existed. And if that&#8217;s the case, how do we find them? How do we tell them that these events are going on? And there&#8217;s a, there&#8217;s a few answers to that in there as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:32] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> That&#8217;s a great point. That&#8217;s a great kind of side effect to come out of the post, is seeing what those additional concerns are. You know, maybe it&#8217;s not as focused around content for their meetup, but how do you get people involved? And so those are areas that we can continue to address as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s important to remember that it&#8217;s not a contest. If you&#8217;ve got three people who have gathered to learn, then that&#8217;s two people that didn&#8217;t gather before. And it doesn&#8217;t have to be big to be successful. Growing a community can start in a lot of little ways that you know, if you&#8217;re helping the people that want to be helped, that&#8217;s what matters most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also starting to look at what our community looks like because as more people go online with their jobs as they look at career transitions and now is a huge time for career transitions. You&#8217;ve got younger people coming in, but you&#8217;ve also got older people coming in. My parents&#8217; generation who are retiring, but have computer skills and are excited about starting their next business or, you know, their third business. It&#8217;s important to think about your community, the makeup of it in different ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that was another one that came out which I found quite curious. This idea that it would be a good opportunity to attract age groups at the end of the spectrum at both ends. So a great opportunity to reach out to new people who probably don&#8217;t really know too much about these WordPress events. Maybe they&#8217;re students and they&#8217;re fresh out of college.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this would be a great moment to get them involved. And maybe not only will they become part of the community, but they might wish to take on some of the responsibility for organizing events like this, but also, and this really hadn&#8217;t occurred to me, forgive my ignorance here, the older end of the spectrum, the idea that there&#8217;s probably a lot of people out there who would welcome an event as friendly and as interesting as a WordCamp and tapping into that resource as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:25] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> Yeah, one of the problems that we had specifically in our meetup is we were all kind of the same age, and Topher and I of course had children kind of early for nowadays. But as our friends were starting to have their children, it gets hard to balance family and meetup and job, and all the other responsibilities that you have. So having a meetup group that is made up of a variety of different ages and life points, or, you know, places where you are in your life, can be really useful to you because you do have those people who are young and enthusiastic or are established and, and reliable, or, you know, young and reliable established, and enthusiastic. However you want to look at it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole community benefits from having people who are at different stages of their life. I know for me, I&#8217;ve actually had more experience meeting people and maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m a little bit older, but meeting people who are on their second stage journey and are embracing WordPress for all that it has to offer. They have a little more disposable income. They have a little more life experience, and they&#8217;re often excited to be starting something new.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I guess it was obvious that some people were going to put comments in about COVID itself and the restrictions around that, and that&#8217;s going to be a big concern for people in terms of, what will the restrictions be? What will the regulations be? Masking perhaps, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And somebody mentioned, and I hadn&#8217;t come across this idea, but they mentioned that this is happening in other real world events that people are wearing what we in the UK called badges, but I believe you called buttons, a little visual emblem to show some sort of status in terms of what you would like people, how you would like people&#8217;s behavior to be toward you, perhaps social distancing. You&#8217;re wearing a yellow or an orange badge or something, and that, the implication of that is I need to be kept away from, I would like that to be a distance between me and other people. I found that really interesting as well, ways to assuage people&#8217;s fear about COVID. So anything like that, they could get in touch with you and say as well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:26] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. And something we&#8217;re looking at, particularly as we go into WordCamp US. From a personal level, I love this idea. Whether it&#8217;s during a pandemic or just any regular event. I grew up Midwestern here in the U S and hugging was never not an option, like, you just hugged everybody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like that&#8217;s what you did. And so it&#8217;s actually been kind of a revelation for me that you don&#8217;t have to hug everybody. And kind of freeing kind of strange to say at 45. Not everybody likes to be touched the same way. Not everybody wants to seem interaction. And so to be more, yes, it&#8217;s coming out of the pandemic, but I think it&#8217;s a good thing to come out of the pandemic where we can, just like we&#8217;re embracing people&#8217;s pronouns, we can embrace their space restrictions as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We had a podcast episode several weeks ago with some people off the WordCamp Europe team. And they had gone to great lengths. We didn&#8217;t really get into the subject of how they had arrived at the decisions, which is basically what we&#8217;re talking about today. We&#8217;re providing, or you are Cate providing a, how we can do things in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was more of an explanation of just what is happening at WordCamp Europe. And that didn&#8217;t come up in our conversation, but it was pretty clear that they&#8217;d gone to great lengths to figure out how they could make it as safe as possible. So masks at all times, testing available and all the eating and the dining and all of that. The socializing is going to be outside and it&#8217;s happens to be in Portugal, so the weather is going to be fairly predictable and reliable. So that&#8217;s kind of good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the fact is all of this needed to be thought about, and we can inject more thoughts if we come along and contribute to your post. You called it blue sky thinking are you really going for that? Is it literally just throw any idea at us and let&#8217;s see? Obviously there&#8217;s constraints about being ridiculous or possibly, you know, rude or what have you but, you&#8217;re just after anything. Give us any ideas, let&#8217;s see. Maybe there&#8217;s a gem in there. There&#8217;s a needle in a haystack that we hadn&#8217;t thought about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:27] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> Yeah. You know, that&#8217;s exactly it. So yes, it&#8217;s a blue sky thinking. Can we act and actually implement every idea that comes across from the post? No, we can&#8217;t do that. We can&#8217;t give everybody a safety bubble that they can wear at each camp. That would be super fun, but it&#8217;s not going to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can&#8217;t make it perfect for everybody, but you never know what part of an idea might come out of a suggestion that was made that seemed completely farfetched. That is actually revolutionary, and it changes how we all operate. So we don&#8217;t want to put limits on people. You have to be friendly. You have to be polite to the people around you, but beyond that, we really want to hear your ideas. If you think that it would be useful to a meetup or a WordCamp organizer, let us hear about it because, who knows?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Coincidentally. Maybe it wasn&#8217;t. So coincidentally, I don&#8217;t know. But similar time, Josepha Hayen Chomphosy, who&#8217;s the executive director of the WordPress project. She put out a podcast episode on her WP Briefing podcast. Again, I&#8217;ll link to that in the show notes, where she illustrated that there are now some mandatory guidelines, Anybody wanting to organize an event over 50 people, basically it can be the local guidelines. If there&#8217;s any extra guidelines on top of the WordPress guidelines, you&#8217;ve got to follow all of those. And in some cases it might be that you may need to do testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in which case, if you&#8217;re doing testing, you have to make sure that there&#8217;s boots on the ground and staff available to make that happen. There&#8217;s a little bit more to it than that. It&#8217;s a little bit more complicated, but I just wondered if, in the future, you had any thoughts on whether these events are going to be more complicated to organize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so whilst we&#8217;ve got the blue sky thinking on the one hand, on the other hand, we have the difficult reality that we have to actually manage this stuff and not everything can be lovely. Some of it is going to be a slog. Some of it&#8217;s going to be difficult to implement. And in some cases it might be disappointing because you may get to the point where you are days away from having an event and the guidelines change locally, you have to pull it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I guess we&#8217;ve got to be just a bit mindful haven&#8217;t we? Over on the one side, it&#8217;s all roses and the sun is shining and then possibly on the other hand, there is a slightly more gloomy side that we probably should talk about briefly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:47] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> Yeah. I think it&#8217;s really important. I mean, this happened to WordCamp Birmingham and our restrictions don&#8217;t match their local restrictions. And it&#8217;s been a challenge for them. They haven&#8217;t been able to restart planning their WordCamp until the current WordPress COVID guidelines change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s something that is in talks. You know, we know that it will be flexible in that they will change again in the future. But we&#8217;re also being cautious. When you have a huge global community with people who range from incredibly healthy to potentially invalids at home, you have to really measure what inclusivity looks like and try to hit kind of a middle point where people feel reasonably safe, organizers feel reasonably supported, but it also realistically fits what a group can manage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s a very difficult balance to try to find. One of the, one of our biggest concerns and one reasons that we&#8217;ve erred on the side of being a little more conservative, a little bit more strict with our guidelines is we don&#8217;t ever want an organizer to feel responsible for the health of their community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like we&#8217;re trying to take that burden kind of on ourselves so that when an organizer acts they&#8217;re acting because that&#8217;s what WordCamp Central told them to do. Any errors on the side of a healthier community instead of a together community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned at the start that you obviously want everybody to get involved in your post. And again, once again, I&#8217;ll just illustrate that the post is available at the make dot wordpress dot org site. And once again, I&#8217;ll say that the links are in the show notes. More broadly if somebody has listened to this and just thought, oh boy, I really quite like to get involved in some of these events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have any pointers, any guidance for people? Where would be their first port of call if they wish to involved in a local meetup or a more global meetup. Where would you point people?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:48] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> Sure. If you&#8217;re looking to get involved, you can go to meetup.com and search for WordPress, and you&#8217;ll find all of the ones that are in your area. You can also find all of the ones and most of them still have a virtual element, so you can get involved in meetups across the world, which is kind of a really great thing that came out of the pandemic, is a huge opportunity for, you know, all of those barriers to go away and to really grow the global community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It did make it a little more challenging, to grow the local communities, but the global ones are easier. If you&#8217;re looking to actually organize, you can head over to wordpress.org and there are a variety of handbooks. You can search for, you know, meetup organizer or a WordCamp organizer, and look through the handbook and see what&#8217;s just involved in organizing these different events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Cate on a personal level, what&#8217;s the best way that people could communicate with you, should they have listened to this and think, actually I want to go straight to Cate. That could be email or Twitter or whatever you feel most comfortable with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:45] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> I&#8217;m on Twitter, at my sweet Cate and that&#8217;s Cate with a C because it is. So you can also find me on Twitter at my sweet Cate. I am on LinkedIn. I rarely Facebook, so that&#8217;s really not a good place to find me. If you want to send me an email, Cate at HeroPress dot com is a good one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m always really happy to hear from the community. You know, if you&#8217;ve got a question, I always try to answer it because there&#8217;s nothing like trying to find information and having somebody just ghost you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I hope that this podcast episode has managed to get people to go and offer some blue sky thoughts. It will be open for the next few days. I&#8217;m not a hundred percent sure exactly how many days between the date this podcast goes out and when you&#8217;re going to be really gathering up those comments and examining them, but they&#8217;ll certainly be a period of time after this podcast comes out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s hope that this podcast prompts a few people to wander over there and give you their comments. Okay Cate, thank you so much for talking to me today on the podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:40] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> Hey, thanks, Nathan.

That’s one weird way to begin a story but that is where I will kick off. Do not be deceived! I was not born with a silver spoon in my mouth nor did I miss a meal in a day, however, there are many others in the community who have a different story to tell.</p>\n<h2>Cut! From the top…</h2>\n<p>When you read most of the articles on this ginormous account of lives (HeroPress), one theme stands out, “WordPress allowed me to create the life I wanted” and my story does not differ from the others apart from the finer details.</p>\n<p>For most of my life, I have wanted to create a leveled playing field for others and myself. That is one lesson my parents labored to teach me; to consider others as well as myself. So for most of my dreamy childhood, I spent my tv-less afternoons contemplating building an orphanage or something that would help those who did not have the gifts/experience I had obtained in the universe. But how would I do this?</p>\n<p>I was privileged to go through school from Kindergarten to University (We shall skip the nitty gritty) and obtained a Bachelors in Commerce. That continues to debunk the myth that most IT enthusiasts (read “nerds/geeks”) have a computer science degree. I do not have one and having it might supercharge my ego so I have sunset-ted that idea. Rather, I have focused to push in a direction that one of my former employers highlighted. He said, “You will make a good product manager one day!”. And I am building some <a href=\"https://mediauganda.com\">WordPress plugins projects</a> to come soon. But let’s rewind to the earlier story.</p>\n<h2>Yah! No CS degree.</h2>\n<p>“But how did you get into the IT field?” you might ask.</p>\n<p>During my high school long vacation, I broke my sister’s work computer one fateful mid-morning. I had to fix it immediately. At that point in time, it was her life’s work. Luckily, it was just the operating system that was broken. I reinstalled it and that is how I learnt about how software worked. Coincidentally, that is how my passion for IT started.</p>\n<p>2 years later, I secretly kept learning new things, HTML but Javascript completely threw me off. So I focused on HTML and CSS which allowed me to make some pocket change while I went through university. I had many corporate clients who sought me out in my university hall for a website.</p>\n<blockquote><p>So I studied 8am-1pm and worked in the afternoons and evening. This allowed me to save up for my first rental fees for when I left school.</p></blockquote>\n<p>(Plays evil music with a surreptitious wink)</p>\n<p>Around 2009, one of my mentors in the web development game, challenged me to convert a PSD to WordPress because the client wanted to DIY the changes on their site overtime without need for a technician. As a reward, he would reward me for the hard work more than I had ever earned. He specifically asked for WordPress. I was lost in a new world. My thoughts only run around the idea that one could D.I.Y.</p>\n<p>I was a business major, not a database guy. I had no PHP knowledge besides googling up how to make a contact form and linking the form fields. That is how I knew how to make websites. This new task had so many challenges. It led me to learn all the theme and plugin basics from the WP repo but all the themes in the repo did not match what the graphics designer had made. I was toast! We lost the contract because of learning and doing time constraints, but I was now on a new path.</p>\n<h2>Sigh!</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/professor.jpg\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>That is how I met Chris Coyier, Jeffery Way, Tom McFarlin and Morten Rand-Hendriksen in that order. Like I said, “I was privileged”. I had the industry leaders show me the way via their video tutorials.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chris taught me how to convert PSD to HTML with WordPress PHP via custom themes.</li>\n<li>Jeffrey taught me how to make plugins. Cementing my PHP and Code architecture.</li>\n<li>Tom taught me about making admin pages with options.</li>\n<li>Morten showed me how to make things mobile and styling complex menus.</li>\n<li>Google introduced me to stack overflow and the numerous WordPress blogs I am thankful for.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(Sniffs with tears)</p>\n<p>Yes, I am not particularly talented but a good copycat. I followed what they did and deviated a little bit making solutions for my clients and myself. I learnt pretty fast and that is how I honed my current skill.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I kept challenging myself and now I <a href=\"https://omukiguy.com\">blog</a> about the solutions and have since started a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/TechiePress/\">Youtube channel</a> to freely share the knowledge I have attained over time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Privilege! Such an elite word with a capital P Dangit! For some it comes in different shades, others societal class, others in the life growth patterns. Why do I highlight this? It is because one never sees it unless they take time to meditate and be thankful for what they have.</p>\n<h2>Some Context</h2>\n<p>For context, I live in Uganda (East Africa) just on the outskirts of Kampala, its city. With over 70% of the 45 million people as youth and above 87% are unemployed. 25% of the entire population is impoverished (US$0.88–US$1.04 per person per day as the national poverty line. This measure is much lower than the World Bank&#8217;s international figure of US$1.90 ). So some of the underrepresentation challenges in the west are multiplied tenfold.</p>\n<p>Yes, Privilege! My education really set me up. I went to “good” schools which gave me more opportunities. Through hard work, I got a government scholarship at university which allowed me to study in the morning and work in the evenings. In contrast, the privately sponsored students had a mixed schedule with no wiggle room. So when I was finally leaving school, WordPress had already set me up with a job. I was a freelance web developer with WordPress experience.</p>\n<p>From then, I had work that trickled in with the e-commerce world starting to grow in Uganda in the early-mid 2010s. I turned my focus to the global market. That has since yielded much better fruit.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I am thankful for the large and friendly people in the community who have continued to shepherd me in my learning through their blogs, tweets and tutorials online.</p></blockquote>\n<p>At some point, the work becomes too much. And as the saying goes, “busy is good!” You cannot do everything. Since the end of last year, we are now transitioning into a full time WordPress Agency with the help that has come my way.</p>\n<p>My dream is materializing. I needn’t build an orphanage when I can share some of my blessings (read work) with others. I am privileged to lead my local WordPress community in Kampala and that allows me to interface/share with lots of local talent.</p>\n<p>I am penning this article at the office desk as I wait for Sharon and Faith; two brilliant ladies that I am co-laboring with to come in and we begin the day.</p>\n<p>We can all change the world with one simple step(fork) at a time.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/privileged/\">Privileged</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 06:00:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:17:\"Laurence Bahiirwa\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"WPTavern: Phi Phan Launches a Separator Block With an Icon Option\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=133282\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"https://wptavern.com/phi-phan-launches-a-separator-block-with-an-icon-option\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3728:\"<p>Less than a week after <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/phi-phan-launches-block-enhancements-wordpress-plugin\">launching Block Enhancements</a>, Phi Phan has released another project: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/icon-separator/\">Icon Separator</a>. It is a block plugin for creating custom dividers with an SVG icon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve tried to support icons in the core/separator,&#8221; Phan said when we last spoke about adding icons to core blocks. &#8220;But it requires changing the markup. So I may create a new tiny block just for it.&#8221; Now, he has checked at least one of the many ideas he mentioned off the to-do list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugins that do one thing and do it well are generally my favorite types of extensions, and Icon Separator is no different. It is also the beauty of the block system itself. It was designed around allowing users to stick small components anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When first inserting the Icon Separator block, it will appear much like any other run-of-the-mill separator. It outputs a simple horizontal line across the screen:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Default output of Icon Separator block.\n\n\n\n<p>Users are welcome to use it in its default state, but that would not be much fun. This block is all about the icon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin bundles over 3,500 icons from the WordPress, Bootstrap, and Ionicons libraries, giving users plenty to choose from. It looks to be a carryover from Phan&#8217;s Block Enhancements plugin&#8212;<em>it would make sense to reuse the same code</em>. The block also allows users to input SVG code for custom icons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It did not take long to pick an icon and begin customizing the separator output in the editor:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Customizing the Icon Separator block.\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin has a lot of options that allow users to make it their own. Besides selecting an icon, they can customize its fill and stroke colors, size, spacing, position, and alignment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The block also has options for customizing the separator line itself, including solid, dashed, and dotted styles. Users can change its alignment, width, color, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Various icons and separator modifications.\n\n\n\n<p>This block is an ideal use case for the reusable block system in WordPress. Assuming users wanted to use the same separator design across their site, it would make sense to design it once and save a copy for use everywhere else it is needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am slightly disappointed that the plugin does not use the <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> HTML element. I had grown excited when last speaking to Phan. I wanted to see how someone would tackle the problem this plugin does, but I expected it to be solved with the semantic <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code>. Part of this was just curiosity as a fellow developer and designer, knowing the limitations it would present as a generic block for use with any theme design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phan took the less-headache-inducing route of using a wrapper <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and placing the icon <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> code into it. That opened far more possibilities, and the block is probably the better for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I wanted to note that this block is not ideal for those who need to use a proper horizontal rule in their content. The <code>&lt;hr></code> element is meant for marking thematic breaks. It is better to stick to the core Separator block in those cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In scenarios where the divider is a design element rather than a break in the content, go wild. The Icon Separator block has plenty of options.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/icon-separator/\">Icon Separator</a></blockquote>\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 00:30:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 6.0 Beta 2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12666\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/04/wordpress-6-0-beta-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5097:\"<p>WordPress 6.0 Beta 2 is now available for testing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This version of the WordPress software is under development</strong>.

While the e-commerce platform already has support for nearly two-dozen core blocks, it&#8217;s not yet possible to use full-site editing for customizing every aspect of a store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept of &#8220;Store Editing&#8221; is still in the early stages with active development happening in the <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block\">WooCommerce Blocks</a> repository. Currently, WooCommerce stores are fully functional with block themes with the help of a classic template block.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We took a very transitional approach to this support by introducing a classic template block that works in concert with custom WooCommerce templates to make various existing PHP-based WooCommerce templates compatible with block themes,&#8221; WooCommerce engineer Darren Ethier said in the roadmap update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More missing pieces from the Store Editing concept will be sliding into place soon with the introduction of the Mini Cart block, a cart button usually found in the header that shows a quick preview of its contents. The Mini Cart block is already available in the WooCommerce Blocks plugin and is anticipated to land in the May release of WooCommerce core. The team is also currently working on adding global styles support to its existing library of blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two new blocks are next on the roadmap &#8211; a Product Search Block and a Dynamic “My Account” link block. As major Gutenberg improvements for templates and menus are introduced in WordPress 6.0, WooCommerce developers will ensure Store Editing has compatibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further ahead on the roadmap, WooCommerce developers have committed to “blockifying” the Single Product Template, transforming every aspect of the template to be powered by blocks. Ethier shared an early mockup of how that might look. </p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://woocommerce.files.wordpress.com/2022/04/single-product-early.webp?w=1200&zoom=2\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The ability to manipulate every part of a product listing, without touching any code, is something that was unimaginable before blocks. It is the culmination of everything promised by the block paradigm in the early days of the Gutenberg project. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A blockified single product template will empower store owners who might otherwise have had to hire a developer to make these kinds of changes to templates. Making customization more accessible is the reasoning behind the concept of Store Editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The primary consumer of everything we build in this new Store Editing environment is the <strong>merchant</strong>,&#8221; Ethier said. &#8220;The end result is that merchants should have more ability than ever to be able to completely customize their store themselves even if they don’t know any code<em>.</em>&#8220;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce did not set a timeline for when the single product template will be fully powered by blocks but the plan is to update all of the plugin&#8217;s templates in the same way. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The move towards Store Editing will also have cascading effects on the developers ecosystem. Ethier anticipates it will create more opportunities for those who develop store customization products using blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Instead of the ecosystem having to reproduce various user interfaces and experiences in the solutions they build, they will be able to tap into a common set of APIs and components to create those solutions,&#8221; Ethier said. &#8220;This in turn will lead to a more consistent and powerful interface for the consumers of their extensions and themes and give more time back to the extension and theme developers to iterate on the unique logic/design of their solutions. There will also be potential for new emerging marketplaces that offer blocks, block patterns, and template part variations as improved ways for stores to be customized.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 03:35:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"WPTavern: Plugin Directory Limits Ownership and Committer Changes on Official Featured and Beta Plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=133288\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:114:\"https://wptavern.com/plugin-directory-limits-ownership-and-committer-changes-on-official-featured-and-beta-plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4241:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Plugin review team representative Mika Epstein <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2022/04/15/featured-beta-plugins-now-limit-changes/\">announced changes for officially-recognized  featured and beta plugins</a> last Friday. Under the new rule, plugin owners will no longer be able to directly change ownership to someone else or add/remove commit access. The purpose is to prevent bad actors from pushing malicious code or premium upsells.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugin owners can still manually add and remove support reps for their plugins in the directory. However, they must email the plugin review team to change ownership or commit access.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Epstein wrote in the announcement:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>This change was made due to the high profile nature of those plugins, and the potential for abuse if a plugin is given to someone who turns out to be malicious. We hope that it will prevent issues like a featured plugin being turned into a premium-upsell plugin.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The behind-the-scenes details were left out of the post. Presumably, the plugin review team would double-check requested changes or block them if something seemed awry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/featured/\">featured category</a> displays the first plugins that WordPress users see from the Plugins > Add New admin screen. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/beta/\">beta category</a> appears first on development versions.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Featured plugins via WordPress admin.\n\n\n\n<p>Active installs range from a few dozen to over 5 million for the two groups. However, the number does not matter, as pointed out by Epstein in the announcement. &#8220;If a 2-user plugin is made a Featured Plugin, then it will have this limitation.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are nine featured and 15 beta plugins. Many of the latter have low install counts, and some have not been updated for over half a decade. Some house cleaning is likely in order.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The limited number of featured plugins is not likely in any danger of changing hands. Most are owned by the WordPress project itself or Automattic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The announcement almost feels like much has not changed. However, the assurance that bad actors have more hurdles to jump when acquiring featured and beta plugins is welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real danger with ownership changes lies with the other 59,000+ plugins in the directory. They have no such added protections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly a year ago, I started <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/dark-mode-plugin-repurposed-and-renamed-to-wp-markdown-editor-change-leaves-users-confused\">receiving reports that the Dark Mode plugin</a> seemed to be doing something fishy. Once a proposed featured plugin, it went from being a simple tool for switching the WordPress admin color scheme to a copy of the premium Iceberg editor project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This new rule change would not have gone into effect for Dark Mode had it existed a year ago. It never made it to the officially-sanctioned point of becoming a featured or beta plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a 17-month-old ticket for <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5509\">notifying users of ownership changes</a>, but there are limits to what is possible with such a system. For example, a company acquisition would not necessarily reflect changes on WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been clear and documented cases of developers and agencies acquiring a plugin and repurposing it. Dark Mode had only a few thousand users when new owners changed it. In the case of WP User Avatar, many of its 400,000 users had to deal with the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/profilepress-rebrands-and-repurposes-wp-user-avatar-now-a-membership-plugin-users-revolt-via-the-wordpress-review-system\">aftermath of an overnight switch</a> to a full-fledge membership solution. I have little doubt that the plugin review team catches cases of a more malicious nature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be a management nightmare for the plugin review team to require manual approval every time a plugin owner decided to update the committers list. However, changing this for featured and beta plugins is at least a step in the right direction.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 01:16:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"Gutenberg Times: Reaching the Future of Full Site Editing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=20962\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/reaching-the-future-of-full-site-editing/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4726:\"<p>As you’ve likely heard, full site editing (FSE) officially landed in the WordPress world with 5.9, with more planned for 6.0 and beyond. If you’ve tried it out, you’ll notice that it was released with a <code>beta</code> label on its menu to indicate it’s in an early stage and that it needs feedback from people like you to evolve it. As people have begun exploring, though, questions abound: Who is full site editing for? Why is it missing XYZ feature? Will it meet my needs? Why was it released now when it isn’t yet fully formed? This post seeks to clear up some of these questions and provide a wider context for this current stage of WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some cases, the suite of features that come with full site editing has unlocked doors users have long wanted to explore, from editing headers directly to making site-wide design changes. In other cases, the current limitations of this initial beta version feel too rudimentary for some to adopt fully. This is all intentional – full site editing needs to start somewhere and will make sense to different people at different times. Ultimately, it was released now in order to get feedback early to better determine what’s needed to get it where it needs to go. If it’s not meeting your needs, provide that feedback and get specific about it <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues\">in GitHub</a>, whether on a current issue or in a new one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Who are the features for today vs in the future?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When thinking about who full site editing is for, as with all of WordPress, the answer is broad: WordPress seeks to be something for everyone. Ultimately, it is being built for all use cases but it can’t all be done at the same time. As a result, it does a disservice to only think about who full site editing features are for <em>today</em> vs. who they can be for in the future as the work continues to evolve. For now, I see these features as being best for the following situations:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>People who are creating a new site and don’t have a deep experience with WordPress terminology/history.&nbsp;</li><li>People who are familiar with WordPress and aren&#8217;t in need of some of the features listed in the next section.&nbsp;</li><li>People well acquainted with the block paradigm and who have a technical understanding of how to make best use of templates, Styles, theme.json, etc. This includes those who might want to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/02/09/core-editor-improvement-curated-experiences-with-locking-apis-theme-json/\">curate the experience</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>People with design skills who want to build a site in WordPress but don’t know how to code.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>What blockers do you see for adoption?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, full site editing likely makes the most sense for those above from my vantage point, but it also <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/how-5-9-creates-a-strong-foundation-for-the-future/\">sets the foundation for so much more</a> and for everyone. If this doesn’t resonate for you, I encourage you to share what would help <em>and</em> to think about what would help all. I’ve heard from many of you and here are a few of the current blockers that I’ve heard prevent folks from adopting full site editing in its current state:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/39183\">A way to lock blocks visually</a> (this is coming to WordPress 6.0!) and in line with user roles.&nbsp;</li><li>More theme.json options for both greater customization and more control.&nbsp;</li><li>More options with the navigation block from mega menu items like having the ability to add headers to a menu to the ability to style interaction states.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/34641\">Improved responsiveness options</a> out of the box.</li><li>Being able to save drafts/more revisions as people were comfortable having with the Customizer.</li><li>Improving the accessibility of the editor itself and establishing accessibility norms for the future of block themes.&nbsp;</li><li>And more! What do you see as a blocker?&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>While full site editing features might not be for you today, let’s help get those features ready so they will be the right choice for you tomorrow.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:00:39] </strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So you&#8217;ve been listening to this podcast for a while. You may be one of these contributors I keep mentioning; you may be an agency owner or freelancer. Maybe you&#8217;ve wondered how to make a WordPress blog for your big idea. Or, maybe you&#8217;re one of the many people who use WordPress for their project or business. Before WordPress was known as a content management system, as a way to get sites online fast, it was a blogging tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have long since outgrown that, but even 19 years into our journey, blogging is still a key part of what WordPress enables you to do. That&#8217;s because even after those 19 years, the mission of WordPress is still the same. And that is to democratize publishing, to help people have a place online where they can tell their stories or share their projects or set up their businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever tried to set up a blog, you know that there isn&#8217;t a lot of information about what to know before you get going at all. So I&#8217;m going to talk about that a little bit today. And just by the way, if you heard the word blog right now and thought, oh, Josepha, how old fashioned? I think it&#8217;s important to remember that there&#8217;s a business advantage to having well-written, relevant content on your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re not blogging for business, because not all of us are, then the benefits are a little different but still important to my mind. Things like the cathartic benefits of journaling, a chance to build community, and the general importance of preserving wisdom for the ages. Anyway, back to the topic at hand. Before we can get to any of the fancy things that WordPress can do nowadays, it&#8217;s important to know a few things as you get ready to set up your first ever website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s dive in. Here is how you need to get yourself started. First, have an idea and a plan. So have an idea for what you&#8217;re doing, the concept of your content, who you want to reach, and some concept of a domain name. I would encourage you to not necessarily get your heart set on a domain name at first. Cause, like, if you want the domain name, wordpress.org, like we own that, you can have that! But if you know that you want a domain like WordPressbloggingforthefuture.com, like that one might be more available. And if you know the kind of words you want in your domain, you can be a bit flexible about what is there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:09]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that you need to do is that if you are just getting started, ask yourself the question, what sort of host do I want? We kind of mentioned all along the WordPress process that, like, you need a good host, but it’s not always clear where that decision has to happen. It happens right here at the start, before you even know what WordPress is most of the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the earliest question that you have to answer for yourself is what sort of host do I want? Where do I want my site to live? So ask yourself how much you want to get into the maintenance and configuration of your website and the hardware that it lives on versus creating content or keeping your shop up to date.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s this whole spectrum of hosting options, and they range from full service where they will keep your WordPress software up to date, provide daily backups, and have customer support if something goes really wrong. So it ranges all the way from full service like that all the way down to essentially zero services, just kind of hands-off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:11]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>They give you a space to keep your WordPress software, to keep your WordPress site. But they leave everything else up to you. They leave the backups up to you. They leave updating up to you, things like. So that&#8217;s the first thing you have to ask yourself. And the first question you have to be able to answer. Most of the time, you will want to start with one of the full-service options. That way, you know that your software is set up correctly and safely from the start. And as you learn more about the software and what you want and what you need, and you have the ability to learn in the time that you have, the more that you can add on either service with the existing hosts that you chose or moving to a different host; however that works out for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if that one sounds like the right option, then you choose a host, go to their site, and actually most of them will have a way to walk you through how to set up a WordPress site inside their system. Most of the time, it&#8217;s just one click and then they ask you some questions to get some configurations right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:10]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other option that on the like zero, zero service side, that&#8217;s not quite fair, but you know, the other side of that spectrum that probably will be appealing to you if you are already familiar with code or already know how to manage a server or, or you know how to work in this thing called c-panel, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you already have a lot of information on how all of that works, you can, if you want to, head over to wordpress.org/download, and you can download a zip file of the WordPress software and set that up in your own environment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, quick check here. If this all sounds roughly doable to you, or at least it feels like we&#8217;re in the right starting point, but you find yourself thinking, gosh, I just wish she would slow down a little.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got you covered. In the show notes, you&#8217;ll find a link to one of the Learn WP courses for getting started with WordPress. There&#8217;s a section on choosing a host as well as various other early steps of this process. So if you felt like I blazed through all of that, which honestly I kind of did, you can work through those lessons in that course, at your own pace, and it&#8217;s, and it&#8217;s really a very good guide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:06:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. Let&#8217;s pretend we did all of that. Now you&#8217;ve got yourself a website. The thing that you will want to do next, or rather the first thing that you&#8217;ll notice once you get your site up and running, is that there&#8217;s this ‘Hello World’ post– there&#8217;s a post that already exists in there. The Hello World post is a placeholder for the common features of a blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There, you can find your featured image, your title, your content, and even some fake comments. You can either edit this post so that you can see how your writing will look from the start, and you can kind of compare like, okay, the Hello World part over here on this page, exists in this field over here on this page. So you can kind of see where everything works, how it all looks together. Or, if you&#8217;re more familiar with WordPress or CMS in general, you can simply remove that and start fresh.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:07:17]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;ve got now a website, we know, kind of, how to look at our posts and create posts, where comments are, where they can kind of be moderated and stuff. And so, the most fun task for everyone is choosing a theme. But if it&#8217;s not a fun task, if it doesn&#8217;t sound like a fun task to you, I can help you kind of do some, choose your own adventure guiding questions here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, you can ask yourself how you want the site to look. Do you want it to mostly be a lot of photos or entirely words, mostly animations? You can head to the theme directory and search for a theme with most of the features that you want. There&#8217;s like a filtering system where you can put in, like, you want three columns so that you can have three columns of text if you want it to look kind of like an old school newspaper kind of layout and things like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:08:12]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also a way to look for themes inside your instance, your WordPress site, but like, if you haven&#8217;t set that up yet, but you do still want to see kind of what your theme options are, you can go to wordpress.org/themes and and take a look at what&#8217;s out there. Just as a quick side note, if you get to that theme directory, if you get to wordpress.org/themes, and it feels overwhelming, which I can understand, I recommend starting with a theme that is designed for blogging specifically so that you can see how things look right away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s actually a theme that does come with every WordPress site. So if you&#8217;re not ready, you can skip this thing entirely and just work with the theme that&#8217;s already there. Every word, press instance ships with a theme and it is fully functional when you, when you get your site up and running. So you don&#8217;t need to choose a theme right now if you don&#8217;t feel ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the other very fun thing that people do with their WordPress sites is to add plugins to them. So plugins are these little pieces of software that you add on to the WordPress software that lets it do additional things. It adds additional functionality. The questions that you can ask to kind of guide yourself through what sorts of plugins you might want, what sorts of functionality you might want to add to your site are a little similar to the ones that you want to ask for figuring out which theme.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:09:36]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So figure out if there are tasks that you need visitors to do. Do you need them to contact you? Do you want them to watch a video? Should they review and respond to questions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a concept of the things that you want users to do on your website, then you can head to the plugin directory and search for a plugin with features that you need. Also, there are just endless lists of recommended plugins out there; if that is something that you find valuable as part of your research, those are also easy to find.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a general side note here, there are even more plugins than there are themes. So if you have gotten to this point and feel like you don&#8217;t quite know the answers to the questions that I shared, and, and it&#8217;s going to be a while until you feel like you can know what those answers are. That&#8217;s totally fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll tell you this. I have never seen a site without a contact form. So feel free to begin your journey there. There are a lot of great plugins for contact forms and it can kind of help you figure out how to work with plugins in that way. So yeah, I made it sound like you can get a WordPress website built in like seven minutes and on the one hand you definitely can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:09:36]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on the other hand, it&#8217;s still a little bit more complicated. So here I have a final note for everyone. You will hear around the WordPress ecosystem. And obviously, here, are some things that could make you feel a little nervous about doing this for the first time. Things like the five-second installation, which WordPress has been famous for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also about how easy and simple it all is. And as somebody who was once in the position of learning WordPress for the first time, like I first encountered a WordPress site in 2009 and I started learning how to use WordPress in 2010. So I can say with confidence that once you learn it, it&#8217;s easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are the easiest of the hard options for CMS. Like content management systems are just complicated, but we are the easiest one out there. And so, as you&#8217;re learning, I want to just remind you to celebrate your small wins along the way. If you feel like you&#8217;re late to this blogging game, like you should have had a website for years. I mean, sure that could be true. And yes, the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. But the second-best time to plant that tree is today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress didn&#8217;t start out powering over 40% of the web, and your first site can&#8217;t be immediately measured in the millions of readers. So, what will your small beginning lead you to?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:12:25]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now that brings us to our small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one, the next release of WordPress, WordPress 6.0, has reached its beta phase. That means the full focus is on finding and fixing the bugs we accidentally created during this development cycle. Beta two comes out tomorrow and you can follow along in the core channel in the Making WordPress Slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve never seen how those releases get packaged, and if you just want to keep an eye on what everybody&#8217;s doing so that you can be the first to know, yeah, Making WordPress Slack is the way to go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on our small list is that speaking of WordPress 6.0, we had the public walk through a couple of weeks ago, which means that in a few weeks, I&#8217;ll do a WordPress 6.0 sneak peek. I&#8217;ll share some highlights of the release features and why I think they are super important for you to take a look. Sooner rather than later.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:13:22]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final, big thing, if you are new to WordPress and this episode has you all fired up to start your blog, we have a bunch of contributors over on the Learn WP team that have just the thing for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can join the online social learning space called How to Make a WordPress Blog. It&#8217;s a free online event that will help you get started. I&#8217;ll link the information in the show notes below. And I&#8217;ll also share in the show notes, a list of WordPress Meetup groups, where you can find more opportunities to learn and get support from other people locally who are also doing things with WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you can also find a list in the dashboard of your newly installed WordPress blog you no doubt have after this podcast.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things.

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about Gutenberg 13, WordPress 6.0, Inline token proposal, and so much more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at The Gutenberg Times and WordPress developer advocate. And I&#8217;m here with my co-host Mary Job, WordPress advocate, support engineer at Paid Membership Pro, and community organizer of WP Africa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also with us today is Dennis Snell, software design engineer working deeply in Gutenberg, WordPress Core contributor, and JavaScript wrangler at Automattic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good evening, Mary. Good afternoon, Dennis. Welcome to our show. Seems we all three are digital nomads at the moment. So how is everyone today, and where are you located, and how is your weather? Three questions right out of the gate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mary, you want to start?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yes, I&#8217;m doing great, Birgit, thank you very much. I&#8217;m right now in Kigali, Rwanda. The weather is quite better than in Nigeria, it&#8217;s not known to be hot over here. It&#8217;s usually cold, but not too cold. And I&#8217;m doing good, thank you for asking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. Dennis?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: Thank you, yeah, thanks for having me on here. I&#8217;m currently in Tucson, Arizona until tomorrow, and the weather is sunny. The high today is around 30. For all my colleagues here in the US, that&#8217;s around 85 degrees. And I&#8217;m having a blast working on some blocks, working on implementing Gutenberg in context outside of WordPress. So yeah, I look forward to this chat today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well, it&#8217;s such a great pleasure to have you, Dennis, and thanks for joining us for the discussion of this week&#8217;s Gutenberg release and your Inline token proposal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But until we start going into the details of both, tell us and our listeners a bit about you, Dennis. How did you get to work on WordPress and with Automattic?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: I have a somewhat traditional WordPress entry story. Long ago, I was building webpages for my clients and wanted to give them more opportunities to edit their content. So I had a hodgepodge of home built, naively implemented content management systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when I stumbled upon WordPress it seemed so easy in order to do what I needed. And so basically from the moment I found WordPress, I almost exclusively used it for the websites I was building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Down the line, I was working at an electric utility as an engineer, and just really wasn&#8217;t getting enough programming in my day job to meet my wants since programming is a passion of mine. And so I wanted to find work that would let me dive deep into programming challenges really deep, and I was also looking to find a job that would give me more flexibility to do what I wanted with my day schedule and better meet my work habits. Again schedule, I work at night a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Automattic had been on my radar for a number of years and it was the pie in the sky dream I had. I applied and basically said I have no professional programming experience, but things worked out quite well. So that&#8217;s how I got to Automattic. It wasn&#8217;t something I expected to get, but it&#8217;s been a good eight years now that I&#8217;ve been there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Wow, eight years. That company has definitely grown in those eight years. Awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, you were right at the beginning, if I remember that correctly, of Gutenberg, and you must know all the depth of the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still share your article, Gutenberg Is Not HTML, from September 2017. And for someone like me who wrote HTML code manually at the web&#8217;s beginning, that was quite a conceptual jump to wrap my head around. It&#8217;s one of the many conceptual rethinking that was done with the development of Gutenberg on how content is created with blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I highly recommend the post to any developer who wants to learn building blocks or for the block editor, but it&#8217;s just the beginning. So then is what other revolutionary concepts implemented with the block editor are difficult for developers of the early internet days, or backend developers or PHP developers? And do you have any advice for them how to learn this better, faster?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: A quick call out to the listeners who don&#8217;t get the opportunity to read that article before I start answering my question, is that I&#8217;ll point out that what I consider one of the more revolutionary concepts here is just that we see HTML on the web as the formatting language, and it is, but it&#8217;s a very low-level language in the way that assembly code is a very low-level programming language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with the Gutenberg block model, we&#8217;ve been able to heighten the level at which we describe the content we&#8217;re creating. And so while the image tag is absolutely the way to display an image in HTML most of the time, in Gutenberg we&#8217;re saying that&#8217;s an implementation artifact of the fact that we&#8217;re trying to create an image in our document. And the same way goes for other content types that get more complicated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other revolutionary concepts, I&#8217;m not sure they&#8217;re revolutionary so much as reflectionary. I think one of the things that I walked through in my programming journey on the web and that I&#8217;ve seen a lot of us do is I think when the web became a popular thing and HTML became the language we speak, we almost didn&#8217;t recognize the traditional programming practices that had guarded us in more typical software concepts around modularization, concepts around organization and design. We didn&#8217;t realize those could also transfer into how we generate web content and web pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can recognize this in the way that we mix HTML and PHP, and even some of the bad rap that WordPress gets for mashing together those different things. None of this stuff had to happen. In fact, even back in the early days where everybody was writing pearl scripts, it was so easy to mix and match content and logic and presentation that we just did it out of convenience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the block model and with the editor&#8217;s data model, what we&#8217;ve tried to do is make the easy option operating on these more designed, structured interfaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that this is all stored in HTML, going back to that article, is beside the point. The point is we&#8217;re able to interact with our modern expectations for creating web content, that&#8217;s things like being able to be responsive on different devices, being able to be progressively enhanced, interacting with other webpages and services out there. We can do this in a way that is principled by the default path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to me, that&#8217;s one of the biggest impacts that we&#8217;ve had. I think a lot of this stuff was a little nebulous in the beginning, it was an experiment. Can we do this? Can we build a structured system? Can we make it work? Can we do it without breaking backwards compatibility? Can we do it while preserving the openness that we love so much about the web?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for the most part, it&#8217;s worked out really well, and I think that probably deserves a lot of consideration and appreciation as we move forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well, awesome. There&#8217;s a similar movement to modernize and to structure and to systemize also in designer systems or design systems starting with the atomic design, and I think those principles actually matched up with Gutenberg. So I think that is where the web and the development on the web was going early on. But bringing it to WordPress, the monolith WordPress all of a sudden and then breaking it up into smaller pieces that then are assembled again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that has been a six year, maybe even seven year journey for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: I looked that up recently, I think it&#8217;s somewhere around there, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But you have been with Automattic for eight years, so pretty much three quarters of your time you spend on Gutenberg and the revamp of how you create content in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So was there anything when you&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if you have it on top of your head or have thought about it. Was there anything that you started out thinking about and how this&#8230; And implement with the team, Matias and Grzegorz and Riad and all them, where you were surprised how it turned out after, I don&#8217;t know, 100 iterations or 100 plugin releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: I was skeptical in the beginning of our JSON comments inside of the block come into limiters, and I was skeptical about how that would all go down. And really what became I should say the driving force behind that were the practical considerations brought in by thankfully the diversity of input at the time among the WordPress community to say, Hey, we care about backwards compatibility. We care about openness. We care about having one source of truth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, like I mentioned, I went back to those early discussions in Slack, which are still publicly available, and we had a lot of discussion about how we would fundamentally store Gutenberg posts. And there was a strong argument in favor of creating a JSON data format that would be stored in the database. There were arguments for storing block information separately from the post content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were discussions about storing all of the attributes and data at the top or the bottom of the post in a delineated area. And so I think what&#8217;s neat about how this all developed is just getting input from a lot of different people forced us through these constraints.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, well yeah, but what happens when you export your site? What happens when you don&#8217;t have the software anymore? What happens when you&#8217;re trying to archive these pages long-term? And I don&#8217;t remember when I was fully went over to the idea, it was after we built the initial models of it. But that one I think is still neat and what I consider one of those happy accidents or happy experiments in history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and I still marvel at the 5.0 release in December, 2018 when nothing broke. The internet did not break with WordPress 5.0. And the conversion of classic content into blocks was very, very seamless. You could open up a&#8230; Yeah, and that was really surprising to me because normally when you change these technical paradigms then there is a strong break of backwards compatibility. And this is definitely a great step for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s still the wonder when I touch a site that still used the classic editor and I converted to block to Gutenberg. Yeah, it&#8217;s still totally amazing for me. So, well I think we could both talk quite a bit and maybe we get a chance to talk a little bit further into it, but we have a job to do tonight, or for me that we have the Gutenberg 13 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>But before we go in there, I think we need to walk through the happenings of last week. There was a recording of the walkthrough, April 5th, of what&#8217;s possibly or not possibly to come in WordPress 6.0. And the recording is now available on WordPress TV and then Dan Soschin published a 6.0 product walkthrough recap with summary and issues list and the chat transcript as well as the video transcript.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to get a sneak peek at what is coming to WordPress 6.0, what might still need some work before it&#8217;s available in Core, check it out. And it&#8217;s about an hour long, so you get definitely a sneak peek and see Matias Ventura, still the demo master of the master of life demos in that show. Did you watch it, Mary or Dennis? Did you get a chance to look at it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: I didn&#8217;t have a chance to look at it, no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: I haven&#8217;t been able to watch it either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right, so let me tell you about the highlights then. The WordPress 6.0 Beta came out also this week and later on we will have some calls for testing. But the highlights of the sneak peak was that the style switching is coming with that you can&#8230; A theme developer can give you multiple theme JSON files and change the nature of a theme, so you don&#8217;t need to change the theme if you just want to change the color palette or some typography or the outlook, the graphical outlook of it, which is still really amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s going to have some great creativity coming into the fold. Then you get more template options, you can use the blocks to edit five more templates, the author template, eight categories tag, and any other taxonomy template. So that is definitely a relief for a few.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a few people have been waiting for few million I think. And then you can easily select text across multiple blocks now and edit them to a liking or delete them. Then there has been great efforts made to keep custom styles in place when blocks are transformed into other blocks, like from paragraph to list or from group to cover. Or a button so you don&#8217;t have to replicate all the settings again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More patterns will come into place with a quick insert that surfaces patterns at certain relevant semantic kind of thing. I haven&#8217;t seen that yet, I will see how the mind reading works from the developers. The list view will have some improvements and there will be some design tools. There will also be new blocks, the comments block, the read more block, the post author biography block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the whole block blocking UI will come into WordPress 6.0. And last but not least, what we saw latest also coming in 12.9 is the export of themes that you created or modified with the site editor. So a question for you all, is there anything that you are particularly looking forward to seeing land in WordPress 4?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: I&#8217;m excited about a few things. I don&#8217;t know if you want to go first, Mary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, go for it, Dennis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: I don&#8217;t think we can understate how valuable the partial text selection is going to be, great work there. Just super valuable for I think everyone, because that&#8217;s something that we&#8217;ve lost when you&#8217;re trying to select across multiple blocks but you don&#8217;t want everything. There&#8217;s a switch over that we&#8217;ve had that it just defaults to selecting the block instead of the text within a block. So that&#8217;s going to be incredible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s I think going to make it easier to adopt Gutenberg and even more context, because those are expectations that people have. By the way, that&#8217;s not an easy problem. And so it&#8217;s going to continue to get better, but it&#8217;s a hard problem to solve in these web-based editors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I saw a comment that Notion, that&#8217;s a project management note-taking application, they just after 10 years or so had that feature, they didn&#8217;t have it before either. So it&#8217;s really a hard thing to do. And having that now in the block editor is definitely something that will improve the writing experience considerably. Because it&#8217;s one of the things that I heard a lot of people who write in the classic editor, they were surprised that wasn&#8217;t working and it threw them a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: Yeah, apart from that, I&#8217;m really excited about some of the underpinnings that we&#8217;re seeing with these style variations to make it easier, to more interactively adjust different elements of your site’s theme non-destructively, to be able to move sliders and visually see the feedback, and close this cycle of okay, anticipate what change might have, code in some value, reload the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead we can just flip back and forth in real-time and see that. And I&#8217;m also excited about the bit that we&#8217;ll talk about later that I put in there, which is just preserving broken blocks. Because I&#8217;m not the only one who&#8217;s ever hit save on a post and immediately after save realized that the block I just wrote is now broken. So we&#8217;re doing a lot of work actually to support other changes going on in future releases, but we&#8217;re doing a lot of work to make sure that if the editor&#8217;s unable to understand what&#8217;s loaded in post content, that it doesn&#8217;t change that or get rid of it. So those are the three big ones for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and I&#8217;m glad you mentioned that we are talking about that a little bit more when we come to the change log of 13. Mary, what is it that you are looking forward to 6.0?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: I think Dennis already hit the nail on the spot. It&#8217;s that more to select, being able to select&#8230; You don&#8217;t know how many times I&#8217;ve tried to select a block and then I have to take them one by one. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Why can&#8217;t I select all of this at once?&#8221; But I quite understand when he says it might look simple but it&#8217;s difficult to achieve, because if there&#8217;s one thing that I&#8217;ve come to realize since doing WordPress support is that the simplest of the problems are the ones that you end up spending the most amount of time on because you underestimated it. So I can relate to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;m excited about that feature, and honestly, I can&#8217;t say thank you enough to all the people who are working on Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;m looking really forward to all the list view improvements because that has been the power tool that I saw, and that has gotten so many small improvements that make working with it so smooth and easy to navigate your big template or your big posts, that there are some really great changes in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So as I mentioned, the WordPress 6.0 Beta 1 has come out. And dear listeners, you are our core team. We need you because the release team has published not one but three calls for testing. One is titled help wanted, test WordPress 6.0, that&#8217;s the direct testing of the beta versions. Not only the Beta 1, next week we will have&#8230; April 19th, we will have Beta 2. And then later the release candidates. So we have that post and it walks you through testing environment, testing tips, then the key features to test, the editor, the blocks, the design, and the theme plugin development or backwards compatibility to how the plugins and themes work with 6.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has been in great detail so you don&#8217;t have to come up with making all the decisions what exactly do I have to test, that is really a great post to follow along.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, Anne McCarthy has from the full set editing outreach program at the call for testing 13 out, which walks you through authoring an author template. That&#8217;s one of the five templates that will come to WordPress 6.0, but it will also walk you through testing the blocks or lock UI as well as customized no results for the query block and more design tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, Anne McCarthy has some very detailed instructions for you. And last but not least, help test the custom blocks for WordPress 6.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So up until now, we had one block for the post comments to add to a template or to a theme, but there was a team of developers who started out similar to the post template, having each data item like the content, the author, the date, the link, all in individual blocks. And now those can be styles, those can be used much more granular in your decisions. But it needs testing definitely, and the testing will also decide if it will come to 6.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s definitely, you got your work cut out for you, dear listeners, if you wanted to follow or heed all those calls for testing. And then there has also been on the make blog an update on the state of the discussion and the explorations for standardizing styles and presets for themes. There&#8217;s a whole proposal was there from Mark Rutwiley and there were comments, and also some problems that themes also anticipate with the full site editing that they needed to be standardized, and the customizations being&#8230; Typography being it&#8217;s how will primary and secondary color change?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All these names, can they be standardized? How custom CSS will be coming into or dealing with blocks and full site editing? So Roman has published a post where he summarizes not only the challenge but also has links to the first explorations and the PRs that you can follow along with and test them. This is all under the big headline style engine for WordPress and Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also has a section there how to get involved, so definitely check it out if you want to be at the forefront of the discussion and decision-making.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Released &#8211; WordPress 5.9.3 and Gutenberg 13.0</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So what&#8217;s released? There were three releases. One was the WordPress 5.9.3, if you haven&#8217;t updated yet or if you haven&#8217;t updated automatically, stop now listening to this, go and update your websites to 5.9.3, security and maintenance release with a few bug fixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to hold off on 6.0 when it comes out, you definitely want to have the bug fix system we&#8217;re backboard from the block editor. And we will have the link in the show notes for the list of changes that come in 5.9.3.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now that you&#8217;re back from updating, WordPress 6.0 Beta came out and we will have the link to the beta release notes. And of course, we have all the calls for testing for that in our show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now we come to Gutenberg 13, it&#8217;s the&#8230; Adam Zielinski led this release and published a release post on the make blog on April 14th. So that was after beta, but all the features that went in Gutenberg 13 is the last plugin version that will&#8230; Which of the features and enhancers make it into WordPress 6.0. Afterwards will only be bug fixes and the like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Grzegorz Ziolkowski, our friend here, a long time co-host, also handled the merge in for the Beta 1 release into Core. And there are also a few things that might not make it, few things in this release that might not make it into WordPress 6.0, and we will point them out as much as we know. But this is quite the big release, it&#8217;s 234 PRs or no, it&#8217;s 234 line items in the change log that&#8217;s about a mile long by 70 contributors with&#8230; Alone enhancements were 90 of that. So that&#8217;s really something.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So do want to start out Mary in the enhancements of the block library?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Okay, Birgit. So we have a couple of enhancements, I&#8217;ll start with the block library. Yearly, weekly, daily archive settings have been added to the archives block. We also have an enhancement to the code editor, which now presents the source of unrecognized blocks inside of the code editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: Well, as alluded to just a little bit ago, this is the preservation work for what I like to call unrecognized blocks, the editor calls invalid blocks or missing blocks. And just the idea is it&#8217;s a workflow that I hit more often I think than a lot of people just because I&#8217;m often wanting to go in and play with markup changes, or I&#8217;m developing a block and it&#8217;s undergoing periodic changes. Or I want to see, what if I made this change both in the code editor and in the visual side now if your blocks are marked as invalid by the editor? It won&#8217;t touch that, it&#8217;ll basically just leave it as is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in the code editor there was this funny behavior where if you went in and made an edit, and for some reason it didn&#8217;t validate properly, as soon as you left the code text area, the content you wrote just would either disappear or change or get corrupted somehow. So right now, it&#8217;s going to treat that just as your plain notebook text editor. It may still mark the block as invalid, but as far as the editor goes, whatever you type is going to stay around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a lot fewer headaches for me for that. And then, yeah, the partner to that is on the visual side, if a block breaks, it&#8217;s going to show the HTML preview and forever since the origin of the project, that it might show the HTML preview if you&#8217;re lucky enough, but it was regenerating that block content from the attributes that the editor already knew it didn&#8217;t recognize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So just a little note there is that if something is broken, it&#8217;ll leave it broken, and that makes me excited beyond probably what it should.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and I think the one stepping stone that a lot of developers found was actually the deprecation of blocks, the whole versioning system of the static blocks. And it&#8217;s so cumbersome for many developers that they decided to go with dynamic blocks right out of the gate or after they went through it with their first block, and render from the front end, from the PHP, which then circumvents that. But it also has a downside that it might take another trip to the server to actually show it and slows down the content creator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I think you&#8217;re doing God&#8217;s work there and angels are working on it to make that experience a little less daunting for a developer. I see blocks that have these big, big separate file that the deprecation of blocks versioning system, that part could be longer than actually the rest of the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: One other note on that is it has been very difficult to create invalid or unrecognized content in the editor up until now. And we often talk about the code view and the fact that this is all stored as serialized HTML in post content as an escape hatch. If there&#8217;s something that you really need to do and the editor doesn&#8217;t support it, and your writing post and you just need to get this published by Friday, you can now go into that code editor and add your custom HTML to your paragraph block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And effectively, what that will do is it will lock it from the visual side because the editor says, Hey, I don&#8217;t know what to do with this so I&#8217;m not going to do anything, but it lets you go ahead and make the change. And that&#8217;ll be saved as a revision in the document so you can always see what it was. And we always have the other fail safe, which is add an HTML block. But sometimes the HTML block just isn&#8217;t as convenient as jumping in, making the change you know you need, and moving on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, thank you. There are quite a few bloggers out there that have always fiddled with the HTML, and now they have this outlet again. That&#8217;s wonderful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Okay, still on enhancements, the column block also there&#8217;s been added block tabs. This means that you can now control the space from zero right space to large app gallery style gaps. The space around your columns is an integral part of your layouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s great. The block gap support is now&#8230; It was already in the gallery and now with 13, it also comes to the columns block. So that&#8217;s definitely&#8230; A lot of people were looking for that to control the gutter so to speak. And then there&#8217;s some&#8230; This enhancement to the cover block is definitely one that gets me excited, when I can use a cover block dynamically and then add the feature image for the post template.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I can use the cover block as a part of my query loop when I want to&#8230; Or my single post template when I want the hero image as a background and then the text of the title on top of it. So that wasn&#8217;t possible before with Core block but now it is, and I&#8217;m glad it comes to 6.0 man.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The group block has two variations, we know about the roadblock variation, but now it also has a stack variation. And that is the first time that responsiveness comes in as intrinsic layout or design layout to Gutenberg, and responsiveness comes now&#8230; Is now available for the group block at the stack, which means if it stacks it in multiple columns, it&#8217;s a flex CSS. So you have four buttons or three columns that are stacked in a&#8230; Or three paragraphs that are in a group block, you can get them to display in a wide screen in three columns, but you can also, when you go to the smaller screens, it stacks them into one column or adapts to the width of the screen. And that is definitely a great feature to have now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, what I like is that the list block gets a box size order box, which means that you can have a background on a list block but the list stays where it is. So the content is not padded on left and right like it was with a group block when you needed it before, the list can now handle background color. And this is awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The navigation block got some updates and it added&#8230; So when added to the template or template parts, now the default is to grab the first available menu that was created in the background when only one exists. So that eliminates a few steps, before you had to click on it and then select the dropdown. There was only one in there, so it&#8217;s a much faster way to add a navigation block and a menu to the navigation block. It also now supports text decoration, like underline or strikethrough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why would I strike through a menu item on a navigation block?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: Builds mystery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s the mystery of the web, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then with this release site, owners can also add a link description to the navigation link blocks, which is definitely an enhancement. Because that could be the beginning of the mega menus that people would like to build with a navigation menu, navigation block, but it&#8217;s not available yet. But you can add the link description to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were also some minor up fixes as well as small changes. Also want to highlight that the post comment block that was previously used is now deprecated in favor of the granular post comments blocks, like date and author and content and link. So it will be hidden in the inserter, although if it&#8217;s not coming to 6.0 I&#8217;m going to keep an eye on it. But we won&#8217;t deprecate the post comment block there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The quote block now also supports color, which means background color, text color, and link color, all that is now coming to the quote block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s also, and we talk about it later, the experiments, a new version of quote blocks in the experiments that uses inner blocks, which is quite nice. But we&#8217;ll talk about it later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: Okay, very good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, we&#8217;re going through the change log so people when they follow along or go back to the release, they can find it. So the RSS block had a few enhancements has now all the missing class names that is needed, you can free pen the HTTP to the URL. Is it HTTPS or is it HTTB, and you can also update the maximum items. I think the RSS block was very rudimentary and now got a few features in there, enhancements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the last enhancement that I want to point out, as I said, there are 90 enhancements in this release and about 30 in the block library, 34 in the block library alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the last one I wanted to point out is the site logo and the featured image in the post template blocks of the site logo for the seam block and the feature image for the template&#8230; Post template or page template there now have duo tone in the placeholder. So even if you don&#8217;t see the image or the logo, you will see that the duo tone has been attached to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few components changes to the borders and the border control, as well as the color palette, but they will seem to be quite technical with most of it not user facing, I think, or you wouldn&#8217;t know. There is the style sidebar, that&#8217;s the global&#8230; Previously was called global style, but that&#8217;s the right sidebar for the template editor for the site editor itself now has a search in the block types list and also has labels for the global style variations, and has a tweak in the preview box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really like when you go through the styles and then you see the preview of the styles, it&#8217;s really cool. The multi selection you can now partially&#8230; Select partials of for instance, paragraph block where you have the last line of the top one, and then there&#8217;s the first line of the second one. And you can highlight those and either make it bold or italic or just delete it, editing over&#8230; It&#8217;s only for rich text I think, but that&#8217;s a huge improvement on the writing experience in the block editor. Definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you can directly link to files stored in the media library by using the link user interface. Oh, what I really like in the document settings in the post editor is there is now a summary panel on top of all the settings where you can see the featured image, the title, and the excerpt. And I really like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you see just a glimpse of the final post when you go into the document settings. And before you hit publish you can see how that is, how it looks, and you can actually have a maximum height control there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. Mary, what is the block locking coming up?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yes, the block locking interface also got some enhancements. So I&#8217;m particularly excited about this because what it means is that as a site designer, if you do create your site for your clients with good and bad, then you can lock the blocks and prevent the site from breaking the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know I&#8217;ve had to do backups to prevent this from happening in the past, so I&#8217;m excited about this. So it also got some enhancements, there&#8217;s PR was introduced to use block lock feature. This makes it easier to assess lock status. Also display lock status, you cannot display lock status in list view. This is good. And then styling changes have also been introduced for this model. This means you can remove those separator lines. You can increase patterns so nested items line up correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can swipe existing icons for locked on locked icon indicators. And you can over this block to see that also. Okay, and lastly, reusable block edit locking has also been introduced. This means that you can&#8230; There&#8217;s the option to lock editing for usable blocks as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s really great. Yeah, it has been wanted for so long and now we have these user interfaces. You were able to lock those blocks as a developer in certain ways, but now a site owner can lock the things for their editors or a theme developer can lock block patterns as well. That&#8217;s also part of this, I believe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is so much cleaner now that people don&#8217;t&#8230; And the reusable block is also important because there were some accidental changes to reusable blocks when added to a post or page. And people didn&#8217;t know that that was a reusable block that only when you hit publish it made them aware that they actually changed something that might have been&#8230; And the changes might have replicated over the whole site, wherever that particular reusable block was used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is really, really helpful. There&#8217;s some changes also to CSS and styling, and it was a bit in discussion where the block gap UI should reside. Should it be in the global standards or in the layout, and I think right now the decision is to have no block gap UI for the global standards but have the block gap appears on the individual block settings level when it&#8217;s supported through the theme or the block JSON.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Dennis, if you have something that I&#8217;m&#8230; Found something wrong that I was saying, please feel free to correct me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: No, no. I have no correction right there. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I didn&#8217;t see you if you making faces or not. So there&#8217;s something that the next one was a change in the block API that allows now multiple view scripts to a block. And it seems that&#8217;s not coming to 6.0, but what does that mean, Dennis. Do you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: It appears that this is part of work to make sending out different versions of client JavaScript and style sheets for different browsers based on support or whatnot. Again, I&#8217;m just skimming the actual PR&#8217;s here. I think that&#8217;s the purpose to be able to optimize, so maybe send a version of the content out to modern browsers that don&#8217;t need as much backfilling, polyfilling support. But no, I&#8217;d have to read more through this. I&#8217;m not familiar with that work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, okay. It&#8217;s definitely one of the efforts to reduce the payload of the page when blocks are rendered and with different contexts you would need different scripts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the next section is then the changes, enhancements for the patterns. There is now an option to pick a pattern on page creation, meaning when you hit add new page the theme could offer you as a site content creator a various block patterns that you can start out with on your page and then fill in the gaps or modify, just have different modifications there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is definitely a great enhancement so you don&#8217;t have to assemble with multiple blocks but you have that one page, standardized page or a subset of standardized page views that you can add to your site. And the theme creativity here is so you can have a landing page and have all the things that you need. You need to hear a image. You have the text, the first flow text, then you have the call to action, and then the pricing list and that&#8230; So your content creator wouldn&#8217;t forget anything or it will all look the same. And you just have to fill in that text and the data for that particular page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it only works when you of course have patterns that are registered with that. There is in the note in the PR you will see how you can check if you&#8217;re a plugin developer or team developer, how you can check if there are post content patterns available. The API is experimental so it&#8217;s not documented, and there is no promise that it will stay that way. So just as a caveat for that particular thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the theme export has gotten a number of features. It converts spaces into tabs with the theme JSON, it declares a version number. If it doesn&#8217;t have&#8230; If the theme declares a version number then the schema link will be added. It restores the appearance tools when exporting the theme that got missed in the first version of it. And now it also sorts the theme, JSON properties alphabetically so you can find things. But it looks a little weirder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the theme export features from Gutenberg 13 have been backported to come into WordPress 6.0. And the last enhancement part is the web fonts API. And right now there&#8217;s a discussion that it probably won&#8217;t make it into WordPress 6.0 because it didn&#8217;t make it to Beta 1. There was feature freeze. And that&#8217;s such a huge new API that it&#8217;s probably not going to make it to 6.0 because it hasn&#8217;t been tested all that much. But you can use it with a Gutenberg plugin, so go ahead and start testing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can register the web ones with the style variation. It will register and queue the fonts by font family. And it will only register the fonts that are required to render the blocks that are present on this page. And there are also a number of optimizations for the HTTP requests when grouping fonts by font family.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we have 43 bug fixes in this release, and one of them, I mentioned that I like all the new features for the list view, but the list view is now one of the most used sections of the block editor I find. And if you don&#8217;t just write the blog post and it really starts getting immensely powerful when using it in the context of template creation. There&#8217;s now the multi block selection and collapsible expanding section that was in 12.9, makes handling multiple blocks much easier. You can move them all together. You can drag and drop them to wherever you want to drop them. Especially when they are nested ones, like with columns or group blocks we have all these nested blocks where you hit and miss when you&#8217;re in the canvas or in your content. But it&#8217;s very easy to point them out on the list view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It now also paints a little box around it around the block when you hit him in the list view on the canvas, it shows you where you are, where the block is. That&#8217;s really neat. That might have been long there before, but I just saw it when I tested it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also see the lock for you cannot move the blocks when they are locked, which is certainly wanted. And you see the lock next to the block that are locked. Say that 15 times, block that are locked in a locked. And now you can also&#8230; There&#8217;s a better CSS targetability, I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s a real word, but you can now, if you style the editor or want to style the list view, you could target the title of the block with CSS, which I find neat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are there any other bug fixes that stand out? There&#8217;s so many&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: There&#8217;s one I think hinted at in limiting the slug to Latin characters, there are some fixes in place, particularly prominent when people are pasting from something like Word or Google Docs. Sometimes you&#8217;d get a funny object character that isn&#8217;t quite a letter and looks weird, so I know people have been working on that just to smooth over one headache.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes if you did that it wouldn&#8217;t necessarily appear in the editor, but when it creates the site slug it adds some extra content you didn&#8217;t want. So that should be patched up now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, okay. Yeah, so sometimes you find yourself having emojis in there, that wouldn&#8217;t work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, thank you for pointing that out. Awesome. So there are&#8230; I&#8217;m skipping over a few of the bug fixes and jump right to the developer experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Developer Experience</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There were a few adjustments to the schemas for block JSON as well as for the theme JSON schema, the block Jason now has an ancestor prop and also supports lock property that is added to the schema. So you can manage that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the theme JSON now adds an avatar to the schema, as well as the title key is now part of the internationalization as well. And that&#8217;s the title key for the pattern that are mentioned in the theme JSON, which is of what a feature that came in 12.9. But this is definitely an oversight to make it translatable for the internationalization.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Experiments</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And we come to the experiments of the section of the&#8230; We didn&#8217;t have an experiment section for so long in the plugin release, and now you have to switch them on when you install the plugin and you have to go to the menu that says Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there is one item there, experiments, and you get two things. One is the list block version two, and the other one is the quote block version two. And both experiments deal with having different other blocks in the list. You can have images or paragraphs or list and lists. No, I don&#8217;t&#8230; You can also use all the other blocks or some other blocks also in the group and have inner blocks support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: We can see what&#8217;s going on is the great implosion of core blocks right now, because we&#8217;re taking all these other blocks and stuffing them inside. So these two experiments are exciting. They&#8217;re experimental because if we were to actually go ahead and do this, we&#8217;d make these changes now, there&#8217;s additional roadblock with backwards compatibility. So we&#8217;re actually building the framework to the point where we&#8217;ll be able to do these in the future without as many steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But HTML allows arbitrary nesting of list content and quote content. So like you said, I know me personally, I use Gutenberg every day for my work journal, I track what I do. And a lot of times I have bullet points. And something I want to do all the time is add a code block inside of a list item, and that&#8217;s not possible unless I just create it as text. It doesn&#8217;t get the highlighting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with quotes and lists, the work is ongoing to be able to embed these things in another. Like maybe you want to quote someone quoting someone else, so to me this is really exciting. The image gallery is using inner blocks now, and we&#8217;re just getting to that point where all these things are embracing the fundamental nestability to expand what was until now an arbitrary limitation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s no reason we can&#8217;t add an image inside of a list block. So keep an eye on these, they&#8217;re experiments again because they introduce some backwards compatibility problems that hopefully will be fixed by the time they&#8217;re done being experiments, but check it out because there&#8217;s a lot of UI and interaction challenges to solve, lots of feedback would help with that. So it&#8217;s exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;m totally excited about that too. Especially for the quotes, sometimes you want to have just a little image of the person that you&#8217;re quoting there or it&#8217;s a description of what the quote is, a description of a picture, and then the picture needs to be someplace else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the code list block and the list is definitely a great use case for that, yes. And I see the compatibility problems that I think Glen Davis ran into that when he was working on the gallery block, the second version of the gallery block when image blocks came into it. And then how to transform them back and forth from the version one to version two and keep some of those settings as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was quite the undertaking, but I can see that the learned lessons there will introduce also for a list and a quote version two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: Yeah, and hopefully moving forward, we won&#8217;t have to have these very long transitions as more blocks adopt the inner blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Inner blocks came much later to the block editor. It came with the columns block but it was a little different implementation before it came to the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: Interestingly just a small historical bit there. The inter blocks were technically supported by the editors since some of the earliest days, but none of the blocks use them and a lot of the UI functionality lag behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are actually some more interesting opportunities we have to unlock in the future if we want to add some complexity into the inner block system, that currently again, there&#8217;s no support in the UI. But the future compatibility is there, giving us some choice. So just a fun tidbit you can pull me aside at a word camp if you want to talk about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and then there&#8217;s another other experimental block patterns to load the block patterns. Why are the rest API? And that&#8217;s the part when the pattern comes from the directory, is that the&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I highlighted it, but then I forgot about what it was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: There&#8217;s going to be a lot of utility to gain from loading more of these things from the API, because there&#8217;s a lot of context where we don&#8217;t need them. And so ideally we only load the code that we want to use when we use it. So this is working towards that ends to make it easier to dynamically load some of this stuff to make the editor boot faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Awesome. Yes, cool. So there are quite a few documentation changes coming in. Some are minor, some are fixes, typo&#8217;s or grammar fixes, and then there were some code quality changes. They&#8217;re quite technical and I&#8217;m not sure user facing. Yeah, I didn&#8217;t highlight any of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Code Quality</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>But Dennis, you wanted to talk about the core data piece and the migration to typescript. What is it about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: Well, this is a very developer centric change, but in the past few sprints of work here, we&#8217;ve been doing a lot of work with typescript in the core system and the data system, both in the package called data and the package called core data, which gets confusing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, we&#8217;re trying to incorporate more and more typescript into the project for the sake of making Gutenberg&#8217;s internal APIs more self-documenting. So if we step back a moment and we think about what typescript is and why it&#8217;s used in the project, fundamentally types in the programming sense are about automating safety and automating bug detection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to that end, the project has a long history of using a type system embedded in JavaScript through comments. And that has worked out fairly well. typescript is taking that one step beyond which introduces a host of ergonomic enhancements for developers to remove some of the ad hoc nature of the way that we&#8217;ve described the types in the JavaScript, and make them a first-class citizen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of those affordances open up or at least make other avenues a lot easier to get, which is what I&#8217;m interested in. And that is the self-documenting nature, because just as types allow the computer to understand our code better, to make different checks for quality, when it understands that it can also communicate back to us. And so the work going on in core data revolves around adding typed information to get entity record and its family of functions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for developers who are doing things like grabbing a post from the server or grabbing a list of tags, or interacting with this entity system that exists there in Gutenberg, what these changes are going to need are a couple of major things. Number one, when you tell Gutenberg to get an entity, it&#8217;s going to tell you what entities are available to get. Whereas before, a lot of time you had to know what you wanted or start reading the source code to figure out what&#8217;s there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the second thing is it&#8217;s going to tell you what data you get back. So when you make that request, you&#8217;ll get an object and your text editor, your IDE can tell you what properties are available and what kind those properties are. Some of that work isn&#8217;t going to land in six, but the foundations are being put in there. And the flip side data is the same kind of stuff, except instead of focusing on API calls it&#8217;s work on the store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you&#8217;re writing a block and you want to get information out, like a block list or the list of inner blocks, or the site title, and you&#8217;re using select and dispatch, what this is going to lead to is when you type select, it&#8217;s going to tell you which stores are available to select from and then it&#8217;s going to tell you which selectors are available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then it&#8217;s going to tell you which arguments are necessary, and it&#8217;s going to tell you the kind of data it returns. So in this process there&#8217;s been a lot of low-level preparatory work, fixing things as mundane as our documentation generator for the project that builds the docs on the block handbook, fixing different linting issues, fixing different systems, like tests, that all break in these weird, specific ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s a couple of big PRs out there for hitting the magic, and as soon as all this preparatory work is done, those PRs will get in and people will be able to start interacting in the source code the way that you might be able to if you open up the developer console in a running site and explore what&#8217;s in the state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I got the high-level concept of that, and I think one question is probably in other developers&#8217; minds as well. Do I have to learn typescript on top of JavaScript to actually interact with the Gutenberg and block editor and the building blocks?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: That&#8217;s a good question, and one everyone asks. And there&#8217;s different ways to respond to this. One way is, well, if you&#8217;ve been developing in Gutenberg to some extent you&#8217;ve already been working with typescript, because the way that the project has chosen to mark the types of the functions and the data is actually being processed by typescript and uses typescript language, they just do it in a way that doesn&#8217;t change the JavaScript from being JavaScript.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second part of that is for the most part, the effort that&#8217;s going on is what I consider the ideal goal. We&#8217;re shooting for the maximum benefit from the type system with a minimum amount of effort to use it, which means things like you won&#8217;t have to be working in typescript when you write your code. But if you happen to call, use&#8230; Or call, get entity record, or get editable entity record or dispatch editor store dot update block, or select block, what this means is that information is going to be drawn out of the core project and presented to you because almost every IDE and code editor these days is able to read that information without you having to write into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So it&#8217;s actually really a tool, you don&#8217;t have to know everything because your IDE is picking up on all the information and you will see what the attributes are, what any of the additional information. That&#8217;s wonderful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And thank you for doing all the underpinnings to that so it can come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: It&#8217;s really about documentation and lowering the barrier to getting involved in some of the core systems that Gutenberg has to offer. And in fact, while we&#8217;re making these changes, because the more we embrace typescripts type system, the more our mentality is about understanding the reality of what&#8217;s there in the code and building a mental model to work with it. So as we do this, as we have to put our archeologist’s hat on and figure out, well, what actually is expected here? What actually uses these properties? How are they passed around? It&#8217;s giving us the chance to go back and document a lot of code that was built in stages organically and oftentimes in haste.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And those documentation updates are going to present themselves when you&#8217;re writing the code. So the way we&#8217;re talking about the style, the theme style variation selector, and closing the feedback loop, this is the same thing. Let&#8217;s get people out of the source code. Let&#8217;s get people out of a handbook, and let&#8217;s put the documentation and the guideline and the instructions and examples right in your editor at the cursor where you&#8217;re pointing it or where it happens to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So what are the editors who would support that? I know VS code definitely would be. What about Adam?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: Yeah, it would almost be an easier exercise to indicate which editors don&#8217;t. So Microsoft&#8217;s Notepad, to my knowledge, doesn&#8217;t have support for this. I don&#8217;t think the old Unix, Linux editors, Pico and Nano, or the stream editor, but yeah, VIM and Emax will support it. Anything that&#8217;s supports Microsoft&#8217;s language server protocol will support it. All of the jet aim&nbsp; software supports it. Adam, Eclipse, pretty much everything universally supports it these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent. And now you have it listeners, we dove into the underpinnings of Gutenberg and we are not done yet, but this was the Gutenberg change log of the plugin release 13.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course we have the show notes in the show note release post from Adam Zielinski, and we also saw the discussion in the release font. I think I mentioned it already that the web funds API probably won&#8217;t be in the 6.0 as the feature hasn&#8217;t received any meaningful testing yet because it was just coming into parts of Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and that concludes also our section what&#8217;s released.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s in Active Development and Discussion</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And we come to what&#8217;s in active development or in discussion, and that was&#8230; Now Dennis, you posted a proposal and that&#8217;s why you are on the show actually right now, that was the trigger why I asked you to come onto the show, because you were exploring something that was missing of the&#8230; And still is, we have these&#8230; Gutenberg takes away a lot of mystery meat from the old workers, not old, but the classic workers kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, what is a widget? What is a shortcut? What is a&#8230; All the other, the sidebar items and all that. And with a short code, there&#8217;s the handling of, okay, whatever is in a short code you can put in a block and it&#8217;s a much better interface. But there are certain things that are missing or dynamic content pieces that are in the flow text, in the paragraph, in the rich text. So that&#8217;s the overall thing. Is that what you have been working on with this Inline token proposal?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: Yeah, and I&#8217;m glad you mentioned short codes because the best way right now that I&#8217;m framing this work in my head is this is like shortcuts 2.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when we started Gutenberg, what we observed is that by and large short codes were somewhat abused in order to build structure into HTML documents. Now the short code system didn&#8217;t work very well, that Gutenberg post in HTML has a sister post that I wrote called short code shortcomings. That goes into some of the details about why short codes failed to build layout and structure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we built the block model, and the block model captures the essence of what was lacking and we all moved to blocks. Well, guess what? On the other end of the spectrum, we have some let&#8217;s call it abuse of the block model to add essentially what&#8217;s inline content, to add what short codes were really good at. And blocks live on their own, they&#8217;re heavy weight, they&#8217;re high-level. And one of the things that short codes are good at is adding something very simple, generally plain text, such as the site title, the author name, the date of the week. And so this has been a long known deficiency in Gutenberg, and there&#8217;ve been some experiments over the years to try and figure out what it means to implement a system for bringing in this other content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s content that has some identity on its own. A site title is a site title, it&#8217;s not an image block site title. It&#8217;s not a quote block site title. It&#8217;s just the site title. The featured image is mostly just the URL of the featured image, it just comes from outside of the post and it&#8217;s not tied to the block for the most part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in this proposal, we&#8217;re looking at ideas of how we can realize this on a technical level and gather input to figure out what people want from this system. It turns out, like most things, there&#8217;s a wide array of use cases people have in mind. And a lot of this work is just decluttering those needs and trying to identify what the different specific needs are, and if they&#8217;re actually the same or if they&#8217;re not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s really early on I&#8217;d say in its design stage, but I&#8217;m actually full of anticipation. I think this is going to turn into something that we’ll see used everywhere, and hopefully will make it trivial for people to write their own plug in to register these tokens or these short codes to change things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People are wanting to do things like write email newsletters that include merge fields like you&#8217;d use in Word to address each email recipient, and obviously pulling in parts of your site or post information inside the loop as we build templates for full-site editing, those kind of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and I&#8217;m really excited about it. And when you, dear listeners want to follow along on the proposals, you also see that Dennis shared quite a few code examples, how this could play out. How would this play out in a plugin or in a block, or the token. Even the comments in the block, how that would show up. So it&#8217;s very tangible to read as a developer and it also helps you a little bit visualize how it can end up exactly as you said, as a merch tag in the newsletter glue plugin that we&#8217;ve for instance used on the Gutenberg Times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how has the reception been, there were a few comments there. What are the roadblocks there to&#8230; What&#8217;s the difficulty in the decision how to go?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: There&#8217;s a lot of people working on this problem and there&#8217;s a lot of people I think that this problem is important to, and so we&#8217;re starting to get some input. And I really appreciate that. I would say where we&#8217;re at right now, the roadblock is the typical design process. This is just the way it works, and I like to repeat good designs are discovered or good APIs, good interfaces are discovered, they&#8217;re not designed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it&#8217;s real easy for us to just think of something, code it up and get it working, and push it out there. And it probably does what we intended it to do in a limited circumstance, in a limited subset of all possible circumstances. And what we&#8217;re trying to do here is go a different way, which it&#8217;s funny you mentioned that there&#8217;s code examples in the discussion thread because there&#8217;s no actual implementation code yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I started prototyping some parts of these ideas a little bit, but didn&#8217;t save that code intentionally. The whole idea is let&#8217;s get together, let&#8217;s write the code that we think we wish we could write, toss it into the stew, shake it around, and see if the way that we have been talking about these ideas actually matches the model that we have when we write the code to use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I&#8217;d say one of the bigger roadblocks right now is trying to understand, is it the same problem or are there two problems in author introduced tokens? In other words, I&#8217;m writing a paragraph. I want to insert the date that the post was published, so I say, when I wrote this blog post on insert the token published date on January 13th, I was racing to get back to normal life after the new year&#8217;s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s one definite concrete use case we have, but what happens if I&#8217;m writing my own block and I want my image to be able to draw its source from the featured image? Well, that wouldn&#8217;t make sense, but let&#8217;s say draw its source from some AI system that&#8217;s a plugin I wrote that goes and asks a computer to give me an image for the post. It may not be a great example, but in that context, I&#8217;ve statically encoded somewhere in the code this thing can accept tokens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are those the same problem? Are they different? And where&#8217;s the line between what I as a developer want to use as tokens versus what I as an author want to use as tokens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I find myself as a block editor always thinking, okay, a developer would do that but do we need a UI for it? Yeah, it&#8217;s the same thing. And I like what you said that the designs are actually only discovered and not built, was that&#8230; Am I quoting you right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: I misquoted myself when I first said it, but I say good interfaces or good APIs are discovered, they&#8217;re not designed. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s a parallel to the system bible where it says pathways to success can only be found, not made. Yeah, it&#8217;s system built and you build systems. So it&#8217;s an interesting field of tension. Do we go all in or do we start small? Where is that? Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, thank you so much for the proposal and what is that&#8230; So what is it that you ask from our listeners, if they&#8217;re interested in that to read and comment?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: Well, it&#8217;s always good to have diverse input. How do you use these things? What do you wish you could do that you can&#8217;t do right now? What do you do right now that is frustrating or cumbersome to do where you have that impulse that says, there&#8217;s got to be a better way to do this? And this is specifically around tokens, short codes. Sometimes they call these pills because they&#8217;re drawn with a contrasting background with rounded corners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google Docs not too long ago introduced the ability to insert some of these things, and various other editors have added the support. We had a very, very limited webpage title builder on WordPress.com where we used that. So we didn&#8217;t like&#8230; When you&#8217;re in WordPress and you&#8217;re telling it how to generate the HTML title, we didn&#8217;t like bracket, bracket, bracket, bracket, curly bracket, curly bracket, Omaha site title.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We found that confusing and error prone, so we built a little, a little token-based entry. And that captures the essence of what we want here, but there&#8217;s a deceitfulness in that simplicity of the end result. And so really just people sharing what they want, what they&#8217;ve seen, what they&#8217;ve done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have one person on that thread who actually wrote a plugin to do this in some form, and we&#8217;ve been talking back and forth, okay, are you solving the same problem as core? Are you solving a subset of it? And this is all that we can do right now is figure out what problem we&#8217;re trying to solve. And it could turn out that it&#8217;s just way simpler and I&#8217;m making it in this proposal. There could be one really simple problem and a separate, much more complicated problem that at a glance looked the same. So just talking and figuring that out is going to be the critical help and the critical way to move it forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And it&#8217;s also going through the plugin repository and see what kind of solutions people came up with, and see, is it possible to do this with the token system or not?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most probably another research angle to that, yes. All right, anything else you want our listeners to know about the proposal, about Gutenberg, about your work? Or do you have any other announcements, because I&#8217;m thinking we are already 60 minutes in, if not longer, to come to the end of our show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: I don&#8217;t need to bore anyone with more discussion, but again, I&#8217;m happy to chat in-person or on WordPress Slack. My username is @DMSnell, so if people want to dig into some technical or philosophical points about the data flow, about the block model, about the editor in general, they&#8217;re welcome to reach out to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Mary, you haven&#8217;t said a whole lot of things today, sorry about that. But is there anything that you on your work for the last two weeks that you would like our listeners to know that is not so much Gutenberg related, but also of course, Gutenberg related?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yeah, not so much Birgit. I think I&#8217;m very quiet today, I apologize for that. Actually I went through the proposal that Dennis shared. I think it&#8217;ll be good to be able to select an image to use as a featured image every time you publish a post. Because before now, you would have to put a featured image. Like if you share the post to Facebook or I&#8217;m speaking from a writer&#8217;s perspective, it would be nice to be able to think of it as a block instead of just a featured image, because sometimes I have to go look for a code to disable featured image straight away because you do some things and then they would show them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you also have your image and the person, you&#8217;re like, no, I want this one to be the featured image and not this one. So from a user&#8217;s perspective and a non-developer perspective, that&#8217;s my opinion. I think it&#8217;ll be great to have that as a block instead of just a featured image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s an interesting use case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dennis Snell</em>: Yeah, a quick follow-up to that. Part of the motivation for prioritizing this work now is being able to use these in block patterns. So a lot of times we want to pull in a pattern with default data and okay, I would really just like to plop in this page heading pattern that references the featured image or references the site title.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so currently there&#8217;s not a good way to do that. So yeah, just like what you&#8217;re saying, but even to the next level of building reusable block patterns that we could potentially share on the marketplace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, before we end the show, I want to invite everyone. There are three calls for testing that could use your attention and also your feedback. If you get in half an hour or even an hour, test the beta WordPress 6.0 Beta 1 or next week, the Beta 2. And the instructions on how to do that are in the posts that we share in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, every time you do this, I would be available to&#8230; If you have questions at BPH in the WordPress Slack or on Twitter, my DM&#8217;s are open. And as always, the show notes will be published on GutenbergTimes.com/podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is the podcast 65, Gutenberg times.com/podcast. And if you have questions and suggestions or news that you want us to include, send them to <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, that&#8217;s an email address.

I had planned to create a layout with a left-aligned Group with a maximum width, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>This would allow the focal point of the background image to shine through on the right. However, neither of the two known techniques seemed to be ideal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most common methods is to use a 50/50 Columns block, leaving the right column empty. This was messy at some screen sizes. However, as <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/making-an-impression-how-to-build-a-post-hero-header-with-blocks#comment-422939\">noted by Andrew Starr</a> in the comments, setting a specific width for the left column and clearing the width for the right-side column addresses this issue. <em>Hat tip to him for finding a way to work within the system.</em> Still, it is not the most intuitive method and leaves an empty <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> in the HTML for no good reason. It feels like a hack that we should not be teaching users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My gut was telling me that my preferred solution was the right one. It was also the simplest to implement without resorting to hacking columns. It uses the content alignment matrix control for the Cover block combined with a set width on an inner Group block. However, I ran into issues with this but did not understand why. That was until I dove back into it this week (I will get to this later). Plus, I am stubborn enough to keep trying something until it magically works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, I went back to the drawing board. Tired of looking at the previous design, I pulled up one of the first pattern ideas I had about a year ago and recreated it with the latest design tools:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>I also wanted to make sure this solution worked well on any screen size. When moving toward smaller viewports, the content should take up more room until it hits the edge. The method in this tutorial handles this beautifully:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>This entry in the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/category/building-with-blocks\">Building with Blocks</a> series walks through how to create this layout. As a bonus, I will also show how to accomplish it with the new Stack block in WordPress 6.0 for cases where a Cover container does not make sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Building With a Cover Block</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For this walkthrough, I am using a custom theme. However, I have also tested with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/archeo/\">Archeo</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/avant-garde/\">Avant-Garde</a>, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentytwo\">Twenty Twenty-Two</a>. It has worked consistently across the entire group. I am also running <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/04/wordpress-6-0-beta-1/\">WordPress 6.0 Beta 1</a> without the Gutenberg plugin active.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 1: Add Cover Block</h3>\n\n\n\n<img />Cover block with left-aligned content.\n\n\n\n<p>For this step, insert a new Cover block along with your preferred image. Most of the settings are not going to matter. I chose toggle on the full-height and full-width options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most crucial part of this step is to select an option from the content alignment matrix control. In the toolbar, it will be an icon with nine tiny squares, almost dots (see screenshot). To align the blocks from the next steps in the left-middle of the Container, select the first &#8220;dot&#8221; on the second row. Of course, feel free to play around with different options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything else about the Cover design is up to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 2: Add Fixed-Width Group</h3>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding a Group block with specific width.\n\n\n\n<p>To contain the content you will add in step #3, insert a Group block within the Cover from step #1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;Layout&#8221; tab in the block sidebar panel contains the only necessary options you must set. You will need to define the content and wide options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the point where I hit a roadblock in my earlier tests. Percent (<code>%</code>) units behave differently from all others. When used, the Group block is always full-width, and its contents are always centered. No others have this issue. However, not all of them may be used for this particular layout. Viewport-width (<code>vw</code>) and viewport-height (<code>vh</code>) units will align as expected but not expand across the screen on smaller devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vital thing to remember is to use a unit type like <code>px</code>, <code>em</code>, or <code>rem</code>. You may also select &#8220;Inherit default layout,&#8221; but how it behaves will depend on your active theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I set both the Content and Wide options to <code>40rem</code> (there is no need for the Wide setting to be larger than Content for this type of design). Technically, this is a max-width value rather than a fixed width. This allows it to adjust to smaller screen sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 3: Add Content</h3>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding custom content.\n\n\n\n<p>For the final step, you simply need to add your preferred content inside the Group from step #2. I opted for adding Heading, Paragraph, and Buttons blocks. This can be anything you want&#8212;there are no rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Building With a Stack Block</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.0 will introduce a new Stack variation of the Group block. Instead of the typical top-down flow, it is a vertical flex layout. I covered this new block in the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-13-0-adds-text-selection-across-multiple-blocks-new-stack-group-variation-and-featured-cover-blocks\">Gutenberg 13.0 release post</a> this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To test the following technique, you must either install WordPress 6.0 Beta 1 or the latest version of the Gutenberg plugin. The alternative option is to wait a few weeks for the general release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 1: Add a Stack Block</h3>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding a Stack and aligning its content to the left.\n\n\n\n<p>Insert a new Stack block in the content canvas for the first step. You may choose to give it a background color or gradient. I chose the latter to keep things fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike the Group block, Stack has content justification controls. If you made it through the first part of this tutorial, you should probably already know where I am going with this. There is a &#8220;Justification&#8221; control in the sidebar for aligning nested blocks left, center, or right. A duplicate option is also in the toolbar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with the Cover block, feel free to play around with the options. Otherwise, set it to &#8220;left&#8221; to follow along.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 2&#8211;3: Rinse and Repeat</h3>\n\n\n\n<img />Fixed-width Group aligned left inside of a Stack variation.\n\n\n\n<p>Steps #2 and #3 are literally the same as when using the Cover block as the outer container. Therefore, you need to only repeat the process outlined earlier. Again, the most important thing is to define a fixed width for the Group block.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-tavern-separator ticss-7e4aecae\" />\n\n\n\n<p>This ended up being surprisingly easy after the frustration I had last week. This is also an example of how powerful the block editor has become and how the user experience can sometimes not live up to expectations. If I am hitting roadblocks as someone who lives and breathes WordPress almost every waking moment, other users are likely running into those same issues. I hope that I at least shined a little light on one aspect of layout building in this tutorial.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 16 Apr 2022 01:21:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg Contributors Begin Early Exploration of a New Distraction Free Mode\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=132904\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-contributors-begin-early-exploration-of-a-new-distraction-free-mode\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3890:\"<p>A truly zen, distraction-free writing experience is my white whale of WordPress features. The one that landed in <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-zen-mode-5-compelling-reasons-to-turn-on-distraction-free-writing\">WordPress 3.2</a> was pretty close to perfect, but the block editor changed everything. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the early days of the Gutenberg project, contributors worked on different ways to improve the writing experience after reviewers said they found it <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/gutenberg-gets-wordpress-wrong-and-is-a-terrible-writing-environment/\">distracting and disruptive</a>, that the concept of blocks <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/not-everyone-needs-everything-to-be-blocks-gutenberg-must-focus-on-writers/\">may not be fully compatible with the simple task of writing</a>. The block editor introduced settings like Fullscreen mode, top toolbar, and Spotlight mode, in part to mitigate the less than optimal writing experience. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugins like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/mrw-web-design-simple-tinymce/\">MRW Simplified Editor</a> and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-iceberg-plugin-brings-a-distraction-free-writing-experience-to-wordpress\">Iceberg</a> have attempted to bridge the gap, but it&#8217;s not the same as having a built-in, core option for distraction-free writing. WordPress does so many things well but I would love to see it provide the best writing experience on the web, without a third-party plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Gutenberg contributors have returned to this challenge again with an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/38928\">early exploration</a> of what a drastically reduced interface might look like as a new setting for improving focus. The PR outlines the reasons for the exploration:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The UI of the post editor is so heavy it makes it hard to focus. Things appear and disappear: mostly the floating block toolbar and the insertion point flashes depending where your mouse rests on the screen.</li><li>Using the top toolbar eats screen real estate.</li><li>Using reduced interface does not reduce much.</li><li>Writing and general content creation can be more pleasant on a blank canvas with little chrome to obfuscate line of thought.</li><li>Having full UI power at the press of a key (ESC) is simple enough.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic-sponsored Gutenberg engineer Andrei Draganescu created a video to demonstrate what a &#8220;reduced interface&#8221; setting might look like. Most notably, this mode keeps the editor top bar hidden and prevents the block toolbar and insertion point from appearing.

It is one of the heftier releases lately, containing the final features that should ship with WordPress 6.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more prominent features include multi-block partial text selection, Cover blocks with featured images, a Stack variation for Groups, and pattern-based page creation. And there is much more to dig through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have covered many of the big-ticket items in this post. However, to understand the full scale of the release, check out the tickets linked in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/04/14/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-0-14-april/\">Gutenberg 13.0 release announcement</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other notable highlights include <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/40122\">spacing support for the Column block</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/39559\">web fonts optimization</a>, duotones for <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/40085\">Site Logo and Post Featured Image placeholders</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/40013\">vertical alignments</a> for blocks with flex controls.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Partial Text Selection</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Selecting text across two blocks.\n\n\n\n<p>Users can now select text across multiple Rich Text blocks, such as Paragraph, Heading, List, and Quote. In the past, highlighting partial text would automatically create a multi-block selection, which is typically not desirable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The change supports hitting the <code>Enter</code> key to delete selected text and create a new block, <code>Backspace</code> for removing and backward merging, and <code>Del</code> for removing and forward merging. Typing will replace the selected text with the new input.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I covered this new feature in an <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/text-selection-across-multiple-blocks-is-coming-to-wordpress\">in-depth post last month</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Stack and Group Variations</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Group block followed by Row and Stack variations.\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 13.0 introduces a new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/39690\">Stack variation for the Group block</a>. The change creates three variations altogether, counting the default output and Row.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first glance, Stack and the default Group block may not seem much different. After all, they are both containers for vertically-stacked content. However, the Stack variation is technically a flexbox rather than a flow layout. I am unsure how this will play out for end-users who may not immediately understand the distinction. However, this should be a welcome tool for building more advanced layouts in themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Stack variation entirely encapsulates any nested blocks, disabling their alignment controls (e.g., align right, align wide, etc.). However, the Stack itself has justification controls for aligning content left, right, and center.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Stack variation with content justified right.\n\n\n\n<p>One setting that may seem unclear is the control labeled &#8220;Allow to wrap to multiple lines.&#8221; There is at least one potential use case for that. It is possible for a  stacked layout to also be horizontal if there is a height set. However, no such height control is currently shown in the UI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Row variation is also much <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/39935\">improved when first inserting it</a>. There is now a clear indicator that newly inserted blocks are laid out horizontally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside partial text selection, users can quickly put the selected blocks into a Group, Row, or Stack via the toolbar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cover Block + Featured Image</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Using a featured image inside Cover block for single post headers.\n\n\n\n<p>There is now a new &#8220;Use featured image&#8221; toggle in the toolbar when inserting a Cover into the editor. Switching it on ties the image data to the block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes it is hard to pick favorites when new features are landing as fast as one can test them. However, using <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/39658\">featured images within Cover blocks</a> is easily one of the things I am most excited about. I already have plenty of ideas rolling around in my head, a couple of which I shared when <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/featured-cover-blocks-and-the-future-of-binding-data-to-generic-wordpress-blocks\">covering this feature last week</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am eager to see what theme authors and users do with it. This opens up a whole new world of layout possibilities for block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Global Style Variations</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Light and Dark global style variations in sidebar.\n\n\n\n<p>Work continues on fleshing out the global style variations feature. First launched with <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-12-5-introduces-global-styles-variations-preserves-adjacent-button-styling-and-adds-alpha-transparency-to-color-pickers\">Gutenberg 12.5</a>, it allows theme authors to ship multiple <code>/styles/*.json</code> files that users can switch between. Essentially, it is a &#8220;skins&#8221; selector specific to the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The update <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/39322\">supports a new <code>title</code> field</a> in the JSON files for a human-friendly label. Otherwise, it falls back to the filename without the extension.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a user hovers a style card in the UI, it flips it to reveal the title and more of the colors available for the variation. Unfortunately, the flipped version of the box pulls the first four colors defined by the theme. This can sometimes result in a nice-and-clean showcase of the variation. It can also be an eyesore that provides no useful information to the user about the style itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors can control this by maneuvering their color definitions into place in their <code>*.json</code> files. But, it is a hack, at best. Because this methodology is not official, there is no guarantee that it will work in the future. Plus, it is a fast way to create disorganized code for those who like to keep things tidy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Border Control Components</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Defining individual block borders.\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 13.0 introduced new <code><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/37769\">BorderControl</a></code> and <code><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/38876\">BorderBoxControl</a></code> components. This is an overhaul of the previous border design tool implementation. It will eventually allow users to define the border width, style, and color of all four sides for blocks that opt into border support. Plus, theme authors will have the same level of fine-grain control via <code>theme.json</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the new components are available now, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/37770\">block support</a> is not slated until Gutenberg 13.1. Technically, it is already merged into the development version of the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Create New Pages With Patterns</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Pattern modal when adding a new page.\n\n\n\n<p>Creating complex page layouts <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-6-0-might-ship-a-feature-for-picking-a-block-pattern-on-page-creation\">has gotten simpler</a>. When adding a new page, a modal pops up over the screen. It allows users to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/40034\">select from a list of &#8220;content&#8221; patterns</a> to insert into the page. This can be as simple as a few blocks for creating an about/profile layout. Or, it can be a full-blown front-page design. From that point, users can customize the parts specific to their sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This feature hinges on theme authors registering custom patterns for the <code>core/post-content</code> block type. Otherwise, users will only see the default editor. Themers should start experimenting with how they can showcase this new feature as it lands alongside WordPress 6.0 next month.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Comments Query Loop Replaces Post Comments Block</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Comments Query Loop block in site editor.\n\n\n\n<p>The existing <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/40167\">Post Comments block has been deprecated</a> in favor of the newer Comments Query Loop and associated blocks. It will still work, as with other deprecated blocks. However, it will not appear in the inserter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comments Query Loop offers a much better designer and user experience. However, it does not yet have feature parity with the solution it is replacing, at least in Gutenberg 13.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the issues I <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-comment-related-blocks-arriving-with-wordpress-6-0\">noted in my earlier coverage</a>, such as the missing comment ID and classes, have already been addressed in trunk. However, there is not yet a solution for the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/40264\">&#8220;X replies to Post&#8221; title</a>. I expect this and the remaining wrinkles to be ironed out in the coming weeks. However, theme authors who build on the bleeding edge should be mindful of existing issues.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 15 Apr 2022 03:29:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"Post Status: WooCommerce Function of the Week: wc_price\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=95997\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://poststatus.com/woocommerce-function-of-the-week-wc_price/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10149:\"<div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">The <code>wc_price</code> function solves your WooCommerce price formatting problems.

These will be used later to formatting a number as a WooCommerce price.</li><li>Next, the function converts the raw price to a float in case it\'s not a float: <strong><code>$price = (float) $price</code></strong>. This is for PHP 8 compatibility.</li><li>Then, should the price be negative for whatever reason, <strong><code>$price * -1</code></strong> does its magic and makes it a positive number.</li><li>Now to the cool part. The <strong><a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.number-format.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><code>number_format</code></a></strong> PHP function converts the original floating point number into a price by using the <strong><code>$args</code></strong> we previously gathered.</li><li>Optionally, <strong><code>wc_trim_zeros( $price )</code></strong> trims trailing zeros. (Yep, <code>wc_trim_zeros</code> is now a candidate for one of the next <em>WooCommerce function of the week</em> posts!)</li><li>We then move to HTML; our &#8220;number&#8221; is formatted thanks to a series of spans, tags, classes and wrappers.

(Please note the currency symbol, the currency position, the price with two decimals&#8230; that\'s all from the settings.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Function Example</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now to the case study.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may happen that you need to display the total discount the customer has totaled based on the items in the cart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\'d calculate this total as a float, and with <code>wc_price</code> you can nicely format it based on the store settings without concerning yourself with them!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\'s trigger a notice on the Cart page: </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>/**\n * @snippet       Display formatted discount | WooCommerce Cart\n * @how-to        Get CustomizeWoo.com FREE\n * @author        Rodolfo Melogli\n * @testedwith    WooCommerce 6\n * @donate $9     https://businessbloomer.com/bloomer-armada/\n */\n\nadd_action( \'woocommerce_before_cart\', \'bbloomer_show_total_discount\' );\n\nfunction bbloomer_show_total_discount() {\n\n   if ( WC()-&gt;cart-&gt;is_empty() ) return;\n   \n   $discount_total = 0;\n    \n   foreach ( WC()-&gt;cart-&gt;get_cart() as $cart_item_key =&gt; $values ) {         \n      $product = $values&#91;\'data\'];\n      if ( $product-&gt;is_on_sale() ) {\n         $regular_price = $product-&gt;get_regular_price();\n         $sale_price = $product-&gt;get_sale_price();\n         $discount = ( $regular_price - $sale_price ) * $values&#91;\'quantity\'];\n         $discount_total += $discount;\n      }\n   }\n             \n   if ( $discount_total &gt; 0 ) {\n      wc_print_notice( \'Your total discount is: \' . wc_price( $discount ), \'notice\' );\n   }\n\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Right there at the end, I\'ve used <code>wc_price</code> to format the total discount inside the notice: <strong><code>wc_price( $discount )</code></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\'s a screenshot of the output:</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"752\" height=\"408\" src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-752x408.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-96000\" />\n\n\n\n<p>(<em>Regular price was $997, sale price is $897, and quantity = 1, therefore the total discount is $100</em>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you enjoyed yet another WooCommerce shortcut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just my <strong><code>wc_price( 0.02 )</code></strong>!</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 21:09:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Rodolfo Melogli\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"WPTavern: WordCamp Europe Publishes Schedule for Upcoming Event in Porto\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=133101\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-publishes-schedule-for-upcoming-event-in-porto\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3260:\"<p><a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2022/\">WordCamp Europe</a> published its schedule today, to the delight of prospective attendees around the world. The three-day event will take place June 2-4, and will feature 29 talks, 18 workshops, and two panels spanning 11 different categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two conference days have general themes, with Day 1 dedicated to &#8220;WordPress Now&#8221; and Day 2 to &#8220;The Future of WordPress.&#8221; A sample of the selected sessions include building block themes, accessibility for dyslexia, creating paid newsletter subscriptions, enhancing performance, and how headless WordPress benefits enterprises. The two panel topics are &#8220;Acquisitions in WordPress&#8221; and &#8220;Building Community through Meetups.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juliette Reinders Folmer, maintainer of the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards\">WordPress Coding Standards Sniffs for PHPCS</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jrf_nl/status/1514172276207403008\">commented</a> on Twitter about the notable lack of backend dev topics and how it&#8217;s difficult to &#8220;justify the (not insignificant) expenses involved just for the hallway track.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Seeing this schedule makes me very much doubt whether to bother going,&#8221; Reinders Folmer said. &#8220;A number of interesting talks for sure, but the lack of any significant back-end dev talks, makes me feel decidedly unwelcome and makes me doubt people like me are even part of the target community.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While many of the workshops are more technical, they are mostly geared towards theme developers. Others in the Twitter discussion noted that WCEU has been moving more towards non-tech topics over the past few years and other major WordCamps like WCUS have also been part of this trend. They speculated about whether it&#8217;s because the organizers didn&#8217;t receive enough technical talks, whether the session reviewers do not represent a diverse array of skill sets, or whether this is a purposeful move to promote non-tech topics with fewer and fewer PHP-focused talks.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Except for us who work on the backend <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f643.png\" alt=\"🙃\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><br /><br />Joking aside, I\'ve mentioned it a few times already.

A combination of 478 commits kept things busy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WooCommerce Blocks Roadmap Released</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In even bigger news, the <strong>WooCommerce Blocks Roadmap</strong> was updated <a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2022/04/11/woocommerce-blocks-roadmap-update-q1-q2-2022/\">for the first two quarters of 2022</a> due to a very busy first quarter. (These reports will come out on a quarterly schedule, moving forward.) In a nutshell, the roadmap includes the introduction of <strong>Store Editing</strong> and moves toward greater customization functionality. Site assemblers, agencies, developers, extension, and theme developers are the target audience for these steps in Woo\'s evolution. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Blockify all the things!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, the focus in WooCommerce development is on initial block theme support, the <strong>Mini Cart Block</strong>, and adding <strong>Global Styles</strong> support to WooCommerce blocks. Next up are improvements to existing blocks while ensuring that relevant <code>theme.json</code> directives apply to the various WooCommerce templates. It\'s also a priority to ensure the relevant Store Editing pieces will work well with the coming 6.0 version of WordPress and new blocks that are around the bend. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Down the road, we will see the &#8220;Blockifying&#8221; of the <strong>Single Block Template</strong> and continued work on new blocks that have been hinted at. These are a <strong>Filter Products by Rating</strong> block and a <strong>Categories Grid</strong> block.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>DevLife Snippets at Do the Woo</h2>\n\n\n\n<p> I have started to pull out some gems from podcast episodes on <strong>Do the Woo</strong>, and I\'ve entitled them <strong>DevLife Snippets</strong>.

Wordfence disclosed the vulnerability to Elementor via its official security contact email address but did not receive a timely reply. On April 11, 2022, Wordfence disclosed the vulnerability to the WordPress Plugins team. Elementor released a patch in version 3.6.3 on April 12, 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wordfence described the vulnerability as &#8220;Insufficient Access Control leading to Subscriber+ Remote Code Execution.&#8221; It received a CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score of <a href=\"https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H\">9.9 (Critical)</a>. The vulnerability affects Elementor&#8217;s new  onboarding module, introduced recently in version 3.6.0. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wordfence published a technical explanation of how an attacker might gain unauthorized access: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The module uses an unusual method to register AJAX actions, adding an <code>admin_init</code> listener in its constructor that first checks whether or not a request was to the AJAX endpoint and contains a valid nonce before calling the <code>maybe_handle_ajax</code> function.</p><p>Unfortunately no capability checks were used in the vulnerable versions. There are a number of ways for an authenticated user to obtain the <code>Ajax::NONCE_KEY</code>, but one of the simplest ways is to view the source of the admin dashboard as a logged-in user, as it is present for all authenticated users, even for subscriber-level users.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Elementor is installed on more than five million WordPress sites, but this particular vulnerability affects versions 3.6.0 – 3.6.2.

Theme authors have been able to include such layouts since the patterns feature was rolled out in WordPress 5.5 last year. However, core WordPress has never provided an experience built around them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This may be changing when WordPress 6.0 ships next month. There is a bit of an 11th-hour push to land the first iteration of the feature. It is expected to ship with Gutenberg 13.0 and WordPress 6.0-beta-1 for testing (grab the <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/need-a-zip-from-master/#nightly\">Gutenberg nightly ZIP</a> to test now).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this week, Jorge Costa merged an implementation that <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/40034\">made full-page patterns part of the page creation experience</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Pattern modal when adding a new page.\n\n\n\n<p>There does not seem to be an official name for this new feature. &#8220;Full page&#8221; might not be the most appropriate terminology. In reality, it is more of a content-pattern inserter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal is to present users with pre-built layouts that they can insert and customize&#8212;plug-n-play style. A modal appears when creating a new page if the theme has any registered patterns for the content. Insertion is as simple as finding a starting point and clicking.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Inserting a content template on page creation.\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, users can also choose to start from scratch as usual by hitting the &#8220;x&#8221; icon to close the modal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There has always been a disconnect between what WordPress themes are capable of and users recreating what they see in the demo. Everything developers have attempted in the past&#8212;from shortcodes to theme options&#8212;has often fallen a few steps shy of creating an ideal user experience. This new feature could bridge the gap in a way that we have not seen before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Want to build that portfolio page from the theme&#8217;s demo?</em> Just go to Pages &gt; Add New, select the Portfolio pattern, and you got it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Want that contact page layout?</em> Yeah, same process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are still some pieces of the puzzle to figure out. The most notable is the initial user experience. There should be an option to disable this entirely for users who prefer to start with a blank content canvas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Riad Benguella also recommended a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/40034#issuecomment-1096367087\">config flag for custom post types</a> to enable or disable it by default. The pattern inserter only appears for pages right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a high chance that the feature could land in WordPress 6.0 because it does not add any new APIs or special pattern categories. Instead, it piggybacks off the existing <code>blockTypes</code> flag when registering custom patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors who want to give it a spin can <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_block_pattern/\">register patterns</a> for the <code>core/post-content</code> block type:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>register_block_pattern( \'namespace/slug\', &#91;\n        \'blockTypes\' =&gt; &#91; \'core/post-content\']\n        // ...\n] );</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>After spending more time than I am willing to admit testing the feature, I am happy with the initial implementation. In the long term, there might be more that it could do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I think of starting points like this, I often want to hand over control of the entire page&#8217;s output. This includes everything from the header down to the footer. <em>Remember, this feature focuses directly on the content.</em> Depending on the theme, such patterns might work well alongside a &#8220;Blank&#8221; template:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Selecting a &#8220;Blank&#8221; page template.\n\n\n\n<p>Templates like this are typically open canvases that only display the content. In a possible future version, I would like to be able to trigger the selection of such a blank template when specific patterns are chosen. Or, perhaps, there might be a mechanism for choosing between &#8220;content&#8221; and &#8220;full page&#8221; patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, allowing users to select a pattern on page creation is sure to be a boon for theme authors. It makes me want to step back into the theme development game for a bit, if for nothing other than to see what limits I can push with it.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 01:52:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"Post Status: WordPress Podcast and Video Picks for the Week of April 11\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=95948\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-podcast-picks-for-the-week-of-april-11/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2856:\"<div class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">This week David has some WordPress business picks.

The new feature would generate WebP images on upload by default for new JPEG uploads and would use WebP images by default for website content. WordPress&#8217; Performance team proposed this update for the upcoming 6.0 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The performance team has heard the feedback and takes the community’s concerns seriously,&#8221; Google-sponsored contributor Adam Silverstein said in an <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/04/12/follow-up-on-webp-by-default-proposal/\">update on the status of the proposal</a>. &#8220;With the help of the community, we will work on conducting additional data-driven research. Based on our findings, we will reassess our proposed approach to enabling WebP by default.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vocal opponents to  the feature characterized it as &#8220;heavy handed&#8221; and pushed for it to be &#8220;opt-in&#8221; only or introduced with a more user-friendly way to disable it. One of the chief concerns is that the proposal has the potential to double the amount of disk space used for images, as it would generate WebP thumbnails in addition to the JPEG sub sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Viktor Nagornyy summarized storage concerns in a comment on the proposal:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>This is not just about image formats. You’re going to drastically increase disk space usage by generating more images. This will affect anyone hosting WordPress on managed hosts with storage limit, their own servers with limited storage, anyone offloading images to S3, etc. This is why there needs to be an option to disable this under Media options. Hidden images generated by WP because of plugins and themes already cause problems. I’ve seen a site generate 20 images for every uploaded image. Uploads directory was 20GB. Can you imagine adding webp images in addition to this?&nbsp;</p><p>This directly affects hosting cost. You will cause a lot of billing issues.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The Performance Team said they are working closely with the hosting community but this change directly benefits hosts that sell plans with tiered storage space limits. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There are also significant conflicts of interest,&#8221; WordPress agency owner Andrew Wilder <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/performance-team-proposes-enabling-webp-by-default-in-wordpress-6-0#comment-421670\">said</a>. &#8220;WebP is a format that Google Created — and it’s Google Engineers who are leading the Performance Team. WordPress agency owner Andrew Wilder said. &#8220;This proposal is designed to serve Google’s interests (making it easier and cheaper for them to crawl the web). And the increased cost for all the additional storage space needed will be borne by site owners, not by Google.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hosting companies may also experience complications as the result of enabling WebP by default that may not be worth the increased billing for customers who are forced to upgrade. Charles Smith, Managing Director at WordPress hosting company WPopt AB, articulated a litany of these concerns for hosts in a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/03/28/enabling-webp-by-default/#comment-42781\">comment</a> on the proposal, especially as it relates to support and backup costs:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Disk space – a vast majority of our users have very large image libraries. While they might not be hitting limits yet, effectively doubling the media library size is going to cause issues for many people. I can see that ending in one of several ways – either they’ll ask us to delete the webp files (so, more work for us, thanks!), or they’ll be forced to upgrade (so, higher fees for them), or they’ll get upset that we don’t offer more disk space for free, and then potentially leave us</p><p>Backups are already one of our major expenses. We invest in multiple solutions, and multiple storage locations. A decision like this will *directly* increase our costs. It will also make account restorations, account migrations and similar actions more time consuming.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In the most recent update, Silverstein said the Performance Team&#8217;s primary objective in enabling WebP by default is to bring WordPress&#8217; image processing to the level of its competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The main goal of this feature is to set the foundation for WordPress to be able to process and deliver more performant formats in the same way other CMS like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.duda.co/core-web-vitals-update-how-duda-leads-the-way\">Duda</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/11/improving-performance-wix-websites-case-study/\">Wix</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/progressive-jpeg-and-webp\">Shopify</a>&nbsp;are already doing,&#8221; Silverstein said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This reasoning is grossly disconnected from the concerns voiced by people who are in the trenches supporting and maintaining WordPress sites. The team&#8217;s initial approach at selling the benefits of WebP, without adequately addressing the disk space issue, has generated significant community pushback in a short amount of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Performance Team representatives responded to concerns in the comments of the proposal, several participants in the discussion grew more irritated, saying they felt proponents of &#8220;WebP by default&#8221; do not fully grasp the real-world implications of the proposal for users. The timeline for bringing it into core also seemed rushed and premature, given that WordPress already has support for WebP images for those who choose to use them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Bottom line is pretty simple,&#8221; WordPress agency owner Sergio Scabuzzo said. &#8220;We are being asked to double the number of images for no good reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There is a small bandwidth benefit in forcing all images to have a WebP version. But we will then have a crap show on our hands in the back end. How manageable are media libraries now? Cool, now double that with another media format. Oh, wait, let’s add AVIF later too…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is a problem looking for a solution, not a decision.

Robert is the Director of WordPress at <strong>Cloudways</strong>. He has also served as president of the Joomla open source project. With his experience and knowledge of Joomla\'s approach to governance, contributors, and the many challenges facing open source projects, the three dive into what the WordPress community can learn from a peer open source CMS of the same generation as WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\">Don\'t miss <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/post-status-excerpt-no-51-comparing-the-drupal-and-wordpress-communities-with-amy-june-hineline/\">our previous episode about Drupal</a> and what WordPress can learn from that project — with guest <strong>Amy June Hineline</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why This Matters: </strong>WordPress might be big, but it’s not the only open source fish in the CMS ocean. Drupal and Joomla are the other two big names that have matured but taken their own unique paths with different governance models, cultures, and ways of getting things done. There\'s a lot to learn outside the WordPress bubble from other projects like Joomla as they experience unique challenges and navigate familiar ones. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\">Every week <strong><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/podcast/the-excerpt/\">Post Status Excerpt</a></strong> will bring you important news and insights from guests working in the WordPress space. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f399.png\" alt=\"🎙\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><br /><br />You can listen to <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/podcast/the-excerpt/\">past episodes</a> of <strong>The Excerpt</strong>, <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/post-status-podcasts/\">browse all our podcasts</a>, and don’t forget to subscribe on <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/1m3xwXbe0MG5BzFVPtB0A7\">Spotify</a>, Amazon Music, <a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS8ySkU5c2M4UA\">Google Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://castro.fm/podcast/c53552c6-1ee0-4fc4-9de4-08ed6bf1ee4d\">Castro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/PostStatus\">YouTube</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"https://player.fm/series/wordpress-post-status-podcasts\">Player.fm</a>, <a href=\"https://pca.st/05rR\">Pocket Casts</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress-post-status-draft-podcast.simplecast.com/\">Simplecast</a>, or by <a href=\"https://feeds.simplecast.com/2JE9sc8P\">RSS</a>. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f3a7.png\" alt=\"🎧\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-mentioned-in-the-show\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f517.png\" alt=\"🔗\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Mentioned in the show:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://robertjacobi.com/\">Robert Jacobi\'s Personal Website</a></li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobertJacobi\">Robert Jacobi</a> (Twitter)</li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/dimensionmedia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">David Bisset</a> (Twitter)</li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Post Status</a> (Twitter)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-spacer aligncenter kt-block-spacer-_02eb4a-f5\"><div class=\"kt-block-spacer kt-block-spacer-halign-center\"><hr class=\"kt-divider\" /></div></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"sponsor-bluehost\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f64f.png\" alt=\"🙏\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Sponsor: <a href=\"http://poststatus.com/cloudways\">Cloudways</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<table><tbody><tr><td>Just like you, we live and breathe WordPress! <strong><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/bluehost\">Cloudways</a></strong> is proud to sponsor Post Status.

Schutzsmith.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Daniel Schutzsmith. Hello Daniel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:28] <strong>Daniel Schutzsmith:</strong> Hello. Great to be here. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Thank you for joining us on the WP Tavern Jukebox podcast. We&#8217;re here today to talk about your approach to website development with WordPress and your ideas about what&#8217;s happened in the recent past and possibly what&#8217;s going to happen in the future. In order to paint some picture, give it some context, would you just spend a few minutes telling us about yourself, how you&#8217;ve come to be on a WordPress podcast, how you use WordPress, and all of that stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:57] <strong>Daniel Schutzsmith:</strong> Yeah, for sure. People may have seen me making the rounds in the past few months at different places to talk it about WordPress. So I&#8217;ve been using WordPress since probably about 2007, I believe. Before that I was using Drupal, and for most of that part has been in the agency world. So making websites for clients. Going from a design to making a build, to training a client on how to use that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>About 2018, I believe I started to get more involved into the WordPress community. Started out as a WordCamp organizer for WordCamp NYC, and then ended up doing work at Miami, which was a last WordCamp right before Covid hit, and also was on the WordCamp US team for 2020, which ended up getting canceled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that, you know, since COVID hit, I was like, I got to get involved somehow, some other way and do something interesting. So I started creating a WP live streams directory. So it&#8217;s just WP live streams directory dot com. It really just shows live streams like your WP Builds every week and shares the different upcoming streams that people can do from their home, while we&#8217;re all home, in the spirit of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And from there it quickly morphed into, you know, I wanted to do my own thing for a little bit, so I did WP Talks as well with my co-host Winstina Hughes. We&#8217;re still doing that. We have an episode coming up in the middle of April and also another episode at the end of April.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for that we focus on more the human side of WordPress but it&#8217;s held on Twitter spaces. So it&#8217;s a live, live event and people sign in, listen to us on Saturday mornings. And then my day job, just so you know, I actually do get paid to do these things as well. Some, I&#8217;m a web development and design manager for Pinellas county government in beautiful Tampa, Florida on the Gulf coast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you so much. That&#8217;s brilliant. Now we know all about you, Daniel. The reason that I reached out to you, or you reached out to me, I can&#8217;t remember how we exactly hooked up, but it was all to do with a post on the WP Tavern. And I will link to it in the show notes, but the post was all about the need as it was seen, to have lots and lots of block-based themes. You may or may not know dear listener that in the future, if you wish to interact with certain parts of WordPress. So for example, you wish to use full site editing, you are going to have to use a block based theme. And you had an opinion on that. Would you just like to share your opinion and give us the details about all the numbers that were being bandied around and so on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:16] <strong>Daniel Schutzsmith:</strong> Yeah. So, I happened to be at the the State of the Word in New York City, this past December where Matt Mullenweg was talking about, you know, full site editing and that future of it, which actually I&#8217;m very excited about. But one of the things that stuck out was he was mentioning about just having, thousands of themes basically built around full site editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Core things that I&#8217;ve come to understand though, is it feels more like we could really do with just kind of a, dozen good themes or maybe even less, that we really start as our starter themes and then build on from there. Meaning that a lot of the things that we would usually put in a theme, like the user patterns, the styles, all kinds of things like that are actually separated out a little bit more and a little bit differently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it makes me think, if we&#8217;re going for thousands of themes, what is that? What is that reason as a purely for the styles? Because a lot of the patterns, as you know the pattern directory is now completely open and anyone can submit a new pattern to there. Those things are taken care of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don&#8217;t need a theme necessarily for that, unless it&#8217;s something really unique. But in that case, I&#8217;d say, put it in a plugin. If you&#8217;re doing a really interesting type of block or something and then put it in a plugin and put it out there. That was my challenge a little bit, and that got picked up on the Tavern and Justin Tadlock was talking about it, and my response to Brian Gardner, cause he was looking at creating another theme, he created Frost WP, which is a full setting theme. It&#8217;s absolutely terrific. So it&#8217;s just, thinking of it in those terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. So the idea is that the functionality that may have been tied into your theme in the past, all of that is going to be available inside of blocks. And therefore, if you can have all of that functionality inside of blocks, what&#8217;s the need for, let&#8217;s say a thousand, two thousand. I believe the number that Matt was shooting for was five thousand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s the point in having those, if all of the functionality can be brought to bear by simply clicking on a block? It&#8217;s interesting. Would your pitch for that be, why don&#8217;t we just have one base theme. I believe, I think it was Rich Tabor who a little while ago, 2019, I believe it was mooted this idea that in a block-based world with full site editing and block themes, why don&#8217;t we just have one theme, the theme which ships with core and everything else could be built on top of that. Does that seem to you to be optimal?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:29] <strong>Daniel Schutzsmith:</strong> Yeah. I mean, that&#8217;s exactly the way I&#8217;m going. So even when you look at the 2022 theme. That could be the base theme for a lot of these things. We&#8217;ve already seen this happening, just a lot of people haven&#8217;t realized. 2020, 2021 those themes had a whole other plugin that someone created called Twentig. It&#8217;s T W E N T I G. But Twentig basically increased the capabilities of those themes to make them like a starter framework in a way. And that&#8217;s very much where I see Frost WP and I, you know, and like some of these other types of themes out there that kind of were you know, out first. Guteen is another good one as well that just came out. Those all really are the base theme to work with, and then you just put the styles around that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing that&#8217;s missing though, from an agency&#8217;s perspective and also just a larger, I think a larger branding perspective is that, a lot of times when I&#8217;m coming up with a design with a client, there&#8217;s a design system, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At my current job at Pinellas county government, we&#8217;re doing a website redesign right now. We start with the design system first. We start with figuring out the digital branding behind all that. What a button looks like, what a piece of content looks like. And the way we modeled it was after the core blocks. We knew that going into it, that we would override some of the CSS to make it look a certain way. The way we wanted it to. All of the different full site editing themes though so far, I haven&#8217;t seen really providing us, their information on what those styles are, what those things are that we can override.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, once someone does that, and I was mentioning this to Rich in one of his Twitter threads. Once someone does that&#8217;s the game changer. Really truly is. Because folks like Elementor know this, they have the design kits, and they have this whole site settings to be able to override, the topography and the colors and everything everywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s loosely inside of what&#8217;s going on in full site editing. And I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s where people are thinking they&#8217;re taking it, with the theme dot json concept. But right now, it&#8217;s not there. So it&#8217;ll be interesting to see where it goes. And if it does become a core thing or it becomes something that someone creates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you think? I know it&#8217;s a fairly bland question, but do you think that right now, we are recording this in April, 2022. Do you think that right now non-technical users of WordPress would be able to benefit from the block editor? Or do you still feel there&#8217;s a lot of work to be done if they were going to try and do some of this full site editing stuff, navigation, and so on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:47] <strong>Daniel Schutzsmith:</strong> So at my full-time job we&#8217;ve been doing this reason like I mentioned, and so we have a lot of editors, almost a hundred people in there, editing thousands of pages and custom posts that we&#8217;ve created. For that, they&#8217;re using the block editor for the most part. There&#8217;s only a few custom post types where we kept to just the classic editor feel to it, just had certain fields in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But they&#8217;re using the block editor. And so, the reoccurring things that come up as people just get a little bit uneasy and unfamiliar of it at first, but once they start using it, once they&#8217;ve done two or three pages, I&#8217;ve actually seen them being able to pick it up and do it fine. Where, it expands or where it contracts more, is that as people get used to it, I&#8217;ve noticed they get into a comfort zone, so they don&#8217;t necessarily explore the other blocks that are available in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they have like their, certain way of doing things or there&#8217;s certain set of blocks that they&#8217;ll just reuse over and over again. A good example is, you could do an image on a left side with the two column image on the left side, text on the right, and so you have a column image and text, but you could also do the same thing with the media block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So people just don&#8217;t realize that. And so it&#8217;s that education, I think, that needs to happen a lot of times. And there are terrific tutorials out there, especially the learn program from WordPress Core. But I think getting the people to those learning pieces is really going to be the thing that any agency or anyone working with an end user in the administration side is going to have to really press on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing I was going to mention was full site editing. No, it&#8217;s not ready for non-technical users. It&#8217;s just not there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. Yeah. Interesting. The thing that I think about the block editor is that just as you said, you very quickly become used to its quirks. So there are certain actions that you might perform and it leads to certain consequences, and those consequences might not actually be output onto the front end of the site, or there might be, or there might be some quirk in the padding that you see on the backend, it looks as though that purple background is larger than it actually is, and you&#8217;ve just become familiar that once you&#8217;ve saved it, it&#8217;s still going to look like that on the backend. But on the front end, it won&#8217;t look like that, there&#8217;ll be a slight difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then there&#8217;s all sorts of quirks, like if you hit the return key, you end up with a blank paragraph underneath that didn&#8217;t belong there. And in this endevour to offer a tool, which is what you see is what you get like the proprietary page builders, like you mentioned Elementor a minute ago, we could list a whole bunch of others. It does feel as if there is still some work to be done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s work to be done on the UI and the UX so that we have this expectation that what you see is what you get is achieved. And I feel that that&#8217;s the direction that the project should be going, and that it literally looks the same on the back as it does on the front. Would you agree with that? Is that a desirable outcome or is that not something we want?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:35] <strong>Daniel Schutzsmith:</strong> I think ultimately it would be a desirable outcome. It&#8217;s a separation of concerns. Elementor for example, like you&#8217;re saying it&#8217;s a WYSIWYG, it&#8217;s what you see is what you get. It&#8217;s, one-to-one pretty much of what&#8217;s going to be on the front end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I first heard full site editing, that&#8217;s actually what I thought the term meant. So I didn&#8217;t think it meant being able to add headers and footers and being able to override templates, because to me that was like, that&#8217;s just the theme thing, it&#8217;s not that difficult at that time. In a PHP based theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s really what I thought it was. And when it was, I was surprised because the one-to-one is more what I would see a lot of folks would want. If you look at other competitors like Webflow or Squarespace, things like that, again, WYSIWYG one-to-one, it&#8217;s something that people are getting used to. So when we pull them from someplace like a Webflow and bring them in and use the block editor, it&#8217;s a little bit of a jarring experience because, they&#8217;re going backwards in time. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a bad thing necessarily, it&#8217;s just, it would be good to know if that direction will end up going that way or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s really interesting though, is Matt Mullenweg actually mentioned yesterday and jokingly a few folks with me were mentioning it on Twitter as well, that we, a lot of us had started on Frontpage or Dreamweaver or something like that, in the early 00&#8217;s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were doing all this types of stuff back then. That was WYSIWYG that was us putting things around the page and seeing where it would go. And now we&#8217;re returning to that again. So it&#8217;s a whole industry of millions of dollars behind this to get back to where we actually started out. And everyone kind of poo-pooed for a dozen or maybe even 15 years, to come back to it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s interesting that you singled out full site editing as the piece which at the moment is the least ready for general public&#8217;s use, and I guess that&#8217;s the road that we&#8217;re on right now. We&#8217;re trying to figure out what that bit of the puzzle looks like, and how it can be made so that it&#8217;s not too complex that nobody wants to use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when to say nobody, I&#8217;m specifically thinking about non-technical users. I&#8217;m thinking about things like the navigation block, which whilst totally usable is perhaps a little bit of overwhelm the first time you use it and so on. But I think that with six coming down the pipeline fairly soon, hopefully some of these things will change and hopefully, people will be drawn to using it and they&#8217;ll find it relatively easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most exciting things for me in adoption is something that you mentioned a minute ago, which was block patterns. And I can see that being the full piece, the entire website, more or less being built off just patterns, which are in the library. So let&#8217;s just get into that. Are you pretty confident? Do you like the idea of block patterns?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:14] <strong>Daniel Schutzsmith:</strong> Yeah. I love that concept. I loved it when we have the, just even the reusable blocks and things like that as well. Anything that&#8217;s going to lend itself closer to the concept of a design system inside of WordPress, I think is going to be a win. I can&#8217;t stress enough that you could even just be a small pizza shop in your town, but if you have some remnants of a design system to work with, it makes it so much easier to kind of know, what things are gonna look like in that website. And so it could just be simple as figuring out fonts, colors, and a few different content layouts, basically, and those are your black patterns. That&#8217;s what those content layouts are. The closer we get to that, I think the more of an advantage WordPress will have over other types of systems like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:55] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The size of the ecosystem means that there&#8217;s going to be a lot of eyeballs on that in the near future, building those things, and by good coincidence, the pattern creator tool launched earlier in the week, and now it&#8217;s available for everybody to test out and see if they can come up with their own patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And again, the barrier there has been hopefully stripped away, and whilst there&#8217;ll be a learning curve to using that tool, and probably it will iterate over time, hopefully people without the technical expertise, without the knowledge necessarily of things like CSS and what have you, who can click things and drag things and move things, will be able to start building up their own little repository of blocks, which they wish to use over and over again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:36] <strong>Daniel Schutzsmith:</strong> This is also a great feature we&#8217;ve seen in other successful page builders before. Elementor does it with their design kit. We&#8217;ve seen Divi do this as well. There&#8217;s even, there&#8217;s a whole ecosystem that&#8217;s created, I think it was called pager cloud or page cloud, something like that, where you could put any of these page builders on the worldwide web basically, and use them again on another site. It&#8217;s this repeatable process, I think that&#8217;s really important that we&#8217;re going to see the, you know, as agencies and even just as developers we kind of latch to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, we had a podcast, not that long ago, all about the block protocol, which we won&#8217;t particularly get into now, but the idea that the blocks within WordPress would become interoperable with blocks outside of WordPress. So it may be that your CRM has a block which you can consume data from and put it into your WordPress website, and at the minute you need probably some sort of complicated plugin and API integration, and that might be stripped away. So the complexity there, the things that are going to be possible, hopefully will compel people to use it and make it much more usable over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You mentioned that you, at your place of work, you&#8217;ve got this large workforce and they&#8217;re interacting with these things over time. I&#8217;m intrigued to know how straightforward it was for them to move to the block editor. For example, did you just say, okay, from tomorrow, we&#8217;re going to do it, or did you have to come up with some learning materials for them and administer things in such a way that they were able to slowly drift into it. What did you do around that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:03] <strong>Daniel Schutzsmith:</strong> So the folks that are doing this, they&#8217;re mostly liaisons from various departments across the organization. Pinellas county government, I believe is a couple thousand employees all together. Like we&#8217;re relatively large for a county in Florida. The folks that are working with us is like one or two people that are from each department.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so for them, these aren&#8217;t folks that are usually doing web design, these are not folks that are usually doing, a lot of editing except for maybe in Microsoft Word. So for that, we needed to really do some training. So we actually did some live webinars. So I did, I think it was two or three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we also recorded it. And those trainings we put right into, as videos, right into the WordPress dashboard. So I created a whole thing in WP admin, and that&#8217;s a whole help section for them. So they have the videos back there they can refer to any time. And then we also took it a step further, and I love doing this. I love making things as simple as possible for people to work with. In that help section that I created, we also had put in little videos that were about 30 seconds to, some of the things that were a late, maybe around five minutes, on how to work with different pieces of content and how to work with the block editor in unique ways that we had created for us, for our organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that really also opened the eyes for people to understand how to create a specific type of executive order, or how to add an event with the events calendar. Things like that. And then we also had plenty of documentation back to the actual Learn WordPress core website as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s really helped over time. That&#8217;s really what it&#8217;s been. We do have, I do have a counterpart that works with me as well, and she focuses primarily on the content side. And so she&#8217;ll get questions from folks on how to do specific things. But a lot of it too is them understanding those materials and being able to go back to there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m really interested in the system here, because it sounds like you took this move to the block editor really seriously. You&#8217;ve created video content and you&#8217;ve got a dedicated space for it in the dashboard. What was the cue? How did you decide, okay, we need to make content around this. Did you just decide, we&#8217;ll just do content for every conceivable thing at the beginning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or did you say, okay, we&#8217;ll wait until we&#8217;re fighting fires and then we&#8217;ll make a video or we&#8217;ll create a piece of content around the problems that are actually being witnessed?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:12] <strong>Daniel Schutzsmith:</strong> Yeah. Me, myself, I&#8217;m a professor by nature, a teacher by nature. So I taught at school visual arts at NYU in New York city for several years. And I can already see the frustration people are going to have. Cause when I was going in and playing around with a black editor on my own projects and especially, one of the first things we had to do before the website redesign is we actually made a Covid 19 website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I got to Pinellas County Government, I got there two or three weeks before Covid started. And so I&#8217;m meeting my coworkers, and then a few weeks later we&#8217;re all working from home and we have to scramble and make a brand new website super quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we used WordPress as the way to do that super quick, very fast. I knew I could get it up and get it running very quick with a minimal team, and also just minimal time to work with. But that was also our litmus test to see really, if we&#8217;re working with a block editor, will it hold up? Will it be something that we can actually work well with?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I had a little bit of, you know, a test environment already with all of our, they&#8217;re called public information officers, so PIOs. So it&#8217;s basically the public relations people in the government. And so they are the ones that are helping me run the Covid-19 website. So I could see from them the frustrations they were already having.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so when we went to do the redesign, I knew right away what videos we would want to do, but also I knew based on the new things that we were creating, the new features we were creating inside of there, that I&#8217;d want to be able to show them that as well. And so that&#8217;s where, a lot of those come from. You&#8217;re right, as things pop up, as things change, as we see little fires or something&#8217;s getting too confusing for folks, that&#8217;s where we make another video and put it in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think altogether we have, it&#8217;s the least over a dozen videos might be a little bit more. Basic things like how to use the block editor in the first place or how to turn things on and off are all dealt with in that, those two webinars I did. So those are also on there. But the little, the short ones are more, more focused on specific tasks they might be doing in there, like adding a new page or adding a specific type of custom block that we&#8217;ve created.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I do like the idea of putting into the dashboard. That just seems really sensible. It&#8217;s just right there. Isn&#8217;t it. It&#8217;s not like they need an external URL. They don&#8217;t have to go to a different website where your knowledge base might be. It&#8217;s just right on hand. That&#8217;s really ingenious. Have there been any breaking changes over the past, let&#8217;s say two years or so, that you&#8217;ve noticed where the things which were once true broke when WordPress updated, maybe there&#8217;s been a modification to a block or something, and then that has stalled you once more. My experience was that the things which worked two years ago still work, but it may not be on the scale that you&#8217;re dealing with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:37] <strong>Daniel Schutzsmith:</strong> For the most part, I do remember there was one thing, Nathan, but I can&#8217;t remember what specifically it was. I just remember the emotion. I remember the, oh Lord, this is not going to be a good emotion that came up, and the heat on the back of your neck, But I remember it was something other people had similar issues and we found a workaround real quickly and fixed it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t remember what it was. It was something, it definitely had something to do with the custom block we had created, and the way it was put together. But for the most part, no the upgrades have been fine, even the fact that now FSE is already built into Core, it hasn&#8217;t messed with our theme at all, which is not a full site editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> No so long as you don&#8217;t put yourself a full site editing theme in the website, then you can carry on as normal. And I imagine that will be the case for a long time to come. Did you rely on any external sources of knowledge? Obviously you&#8217;ve created your own content. I&#8217;m just curious to know whether or not you were also directing people to tutorials elsewhere. Some of the initiatives that wordpress.org are doing. The learn initiative and so on. I don&#8217;t know if any of that got used and whether it was useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:37] <strong>Daniel Schutzsmith:</strong> Yeah. Learn.wordpress.org, that&#8217;s really the main one that we have external links to and some of the specific tutorials on how to use the block editor. I didn&#8217;t have people go through like the workshops there or the lesson plans or anything like that. I think that&#8217;d be kind of an overkill overkill for this group, but definitely for developers I work with, when they want to know, especially for full site editing and they want to know, what it&#8217;s about, what things are coming, how it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s where I&#8217;ve been pointing people. It&#8217;s just, take a look at learn dot WordPress.org, because really, they have their pulse, they have the thumb on the pulse of what&#8217;s happening with all that and how it&#8217;s changing so rapidly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Now that you&#8217;ve got this experience of shifting a team of people over, do you try in any way to disseminate that knowledge to other people? I mean, obviously here you are on a podcast. You&#8217;re attempting to do it in this way, but I was curious if you took that any further and were linking up with other people, organizations maybe nearby or far away, remotely or close to home to enable them to assist them in this process should they wish to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:31] <strong>Daniel Schutzsmith:</strong> Yeah, not yet. So usually the way I operate and I&#8217;ve done this model a few times, I&#8217;ve done a similar thing with non-profits, tech and WordPress websites over there and I&#8217;ll do the same thing in the government spaces. Usually I&#8217;ll go through the motions and I&#8217;ll try these things out myself, do a little case study, and then from there probably do a little tour of speaking or sharing or putting it out on different trade publications. For this, I&#8217;ve been going more towards Twitter and towards the WordPress communities and talking about it. So it&#8217;s been really cool to kind of, have that conversation with folks so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> One of the things which I find curious is that in the more recent past, if we go back, let&#8217;s say a decade or more, it was fairly difficult to use WordPress. And I don&#8217;t mean that in the sense that it was really difficult. I just mean it was a difficult job for a non-technical person. You had to be relatively prepared. You had to probably get out some reading materials and learn a bit of PHP and CSS and HTML and all of that. The last five, ten years have seen a real shift away from that. Obviously the block editor is trying to emulate that shift in the industry to more, what you see is what you get tools. I wonder if we&#8217;re going to lose something in our community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wonder if there&#8217;s going to be a real stark divide between the people who code, which may be smaller as a proportion of the user base of WordPress, and then the rest of us who are just building things and never dabbling in the code. And I wonder if it will have an impact on our wonderful community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:54] <strong>Daniel Schutzsmith:</strong> Yeah. So I see two things. I do see no code as the future. I&#8217;ve thought that for a long time even more than a dozen years or so. When Webflow was starting up, I actually reached out to Vlad. This was about 2000 and oh, I think 2011, maybe something like that. And I said to him, you know, this would be great for WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like we should do this over there because we need to really make it easier to work with WordPress stuff. And he decided he just wanted to do his own thing. And that&#8217;s how, Webflow became Webflow, with it&#8217;s own ecosystem. I think that future is where we&#8217;re going with WordPress gosh, I hope so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the one thing I want people to realize is I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to be a separation of factions between like developers and builders. The problem, I think that happens a lot of times as we put ourselves in those spaces. And we say like, well, I&#8217;m a developer and this is going to take away a job from me or it&#8217;s going to make life more difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a developer and I&#8217;m actually very excited about that because if I can make tools that way, or if I could take the thinking I already have about web development about using HTML and CSS, PHP, and JavaScript and bring it into that environment. I already have an advantage of that thinking of that way of thinking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when these building tools surface, it just makes it much, much easier to kind of work with. What also kind of interests me is the core tenant of WordPress. The core tenant of WordPress is about democratizing publishing. What better way to democratize publishing than to actually go into more no code of solutions to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t see us not needing WordPress developers. The one thing I am a little bit confused at, for full site editing though, is how we do the more complex things. So it seems because of the way false editing works, there&#8217;s no PHP in it. It&#8217;s really HTML and json basically, and CSS. Where we put in the logic that we would usually put in the theme. The things we would usually do on a functions dot PHP file or the things that we would usually throw in to kind of override different PHP things. With templating, how are we doing in this FSE environment?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And people have kind of hinted to that and explain, you know, and, and, surely things like the query block help with that, but they don&#8217;t go far enough. There&#8217;s a large disconnect between the work that we do, on a larger sites with customizations on agency types of projects that just can&#8217;t be done in FSE yet because those limitations are there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m really interested to see where that goes as well. I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re going to completely ignore it. I don&#8217;t think they can. That&#8217;s part of the problem. You have to find ways to make it more custom and capable to make those changes. But it&#8217;s going to take some definite, changing of thinking for a lot of us on how we would work with things, for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What&#8217;s keeping you excited in this industry these days. Keeping it to WordPress, what are the things which are actually causing you be optimistic about the future. And making you pause for thought and think that&#8217;s something I want to be getting involved in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:39] <strong>Daniel Schutzsmith:</strong> Yeah, a large part of me, I know people have been concerned, I&#8217;ve been concerned too with, you know, the direction WordPress goes, and for the community, as far as some of the things that are happening in Core. Full site editing, all those types of things. I get that change is difficult, but I also really am excited about that and kind of embraced it. The things I&#8217;m getting even more excited about are the areas that not a lot of us have touched on yet, which are automation, which you see a lot in the no-code space. So for instance, you&#8217;ll see people moving data around from like Airtable to Bubble to a Webflow. It hasn&#8217;t happened as much or earliest isn&#8217;t talked about as much inside of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there are great tools out there, like Uncanny Automator, Zapier that can do these types of things. But I don&#8217;t think people realize that we have that capability. Joe Casabona has been talking about it a lot lately in the past year with his creators course, and that whole concept of automating all of this stuff, making it so that you literally don&#8217;t have to keep copying and pasting things from your WordPress site until whatever data sheet you&#8217;re using or whatever you&#8217;re doing. All that stuff to me is really important to the future of where we&#8217;re going. Combine that though with Bertha.ai, which I think you&#8217;ve played around with before. Is that right? Nathan? Yeah. So Bertha.ai, very similar to Jasper, which used to be called Jarvis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a artificial intelligence basically to help you write content. Created by Andrew Palmer and Vito Peleg. The thing that excites me about that is not so much that again, it&#8217;s not going to replace editors. It&#8217;s not going to replace people writing content. It&#8217;s actually going to help them do it better and do it faster. That&#8217;s the way I see a lot of this stuff. For web development in Visual Studio Code there was this thing that came up from Github that actually allows us to just start typing in a few pieces of code. And it&#8217;ll actually complete the whole thing for us. All with artificial intelligence, same concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those types of things to me, rather than being afraid of them or walking away from them, I&#8217;m really looking to embrace them and see how we can use them to speed things up. If I can, like the sites I&#8217;ve created so far WP live streams directory, WP developer&#8217;s toolbox. This past weekend I made a thing called tiny press.email, which is purely just, three links, once a week that I sent out about WordPress design and development. Putting those things together, if I can do those in a few hours or a day, like that&#8217;s huge. If we can come up with concepts and just build them out super quick, that to me changes the game. So it changes the game for what we do, for us being entrepreneurs, for us working with clients, really changes the game. It makes everything speed up and be able to come to fruition much quicker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I remember the moment when I was at a WordCamp, it was in WordCamp London, and there was a talk by, I believe it was somebody working for Adobe and they were talking about the future of building websites, not necessarily WordPress, but just websites in general. And just the idea that you would be able to talk to the website and instruct it in the way you wished it to change. So it might be okay, make that the box on the left red. And can we have rounded corners of about five pixels? Let&#8217;s try that. Oh no, make it 10. And can we make the picture of a dog now a cat? These were the examples that were coming out of his mouth and this is what he is working on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And just thinking, gosh, that just seems like something out of Star Trek, frankly. And yet this is the direction that we&#8217;re heading in, and it always feels to me, like we now think we&#8217;ve got a mature internet, but if you think about it, we&#8217;re still, we&#8217;re not even at the toddler stage of the internet really yet, are we?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s so much, which is going to happen in the days weeks to come. You think about the way that technology has been put into your back pocket in the last 10 years, that&#8217;s all it&#8217;s taken for mass computing power to be available in everybody&#8217;s hand. Imagine what we&#8217;ll be seeing in another 10 years. I like the excitement that you&#8217;ve got around that. That&#8217;s really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:26] <strong>Daniel Schutzsmith:</strong> The thing I was gonna mention too, you mentioned Adobe there. They actually are a great example of this as well because the gentleman you talked to might have actually been from the Adobe marketing program there. Adobe has its own CMS and its own marketing suite, which most people don&#8217;t know about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people know Adobe have Photoshop and Illustrator and all that stuff. But the marketing suite is enterprise level and basically the way it works is it watches you and changes the website based on your interaction with that brand, either in their app, on the website in actual environments, like going to a store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it sees all the times that you&#8217;re basically interacting with that and will change what actually shows up on a homepage or change what shows up on a product page to cater to you. And so most people don&#8217;t realize that they have this capability already. I&#8217;ve seen maybe one or two plugins out there that did something similar with WordPress, but no one really took off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think they actually even shuttered at the time. But to me that&#8217;s another market where creating this whole environment that makes websites, respond to how you interact with them is also a huge thing that, it&#8217;s just wide open for the picking with AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The best that I&#8217;ve seen in that regard are plugins, which can modify dynamically based upon certain conditions. So it may be that you&#8217;ve come from a particular website. And so it then displays, I don&#8217;t know, some additional messaging based upon where you&#8217;ve come from, or it may be that you&#8217;re in a particular geographical location, but that&#8217;s very much based on hard data. Whereas what you&#8217;re describing is, really kind of a bit fuzzy around the edges isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s things which at the minute are in the realm of humans. A human can detect that your eyes are dwelling on this part of the page. So there must be some interest about that thing. Really fascinating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to ask you two questions and they&#8217;re basically the same question, but they might have different outcomes. I don&#8217;t know. So we spent the podcast talking about how you and your team have moved to the block editor and how you found that. Personally, if you were to build a blog tomorrow, just a blog where you are putting content, images, videos, text, and all that. Would you use the block editor to do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, if you were doing a site the very same day, but it was much more complicated in design, would you be using the block editor for that? Or would you still be going and using a page builder?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:45] <strong>Daniel Schutzsmith:</strong> So if I&#8217;m just building a basic site, I&#8217;m just trying to put things together. Lately I&#8217;ve been really excited using either the 2021 theme or 2022. But I&#8217;m not sold on FSE yet. So the full site editing experience is a little bit more difficult to work with. So, ironically I&#8217;ve been using 2021 theme for my latest projects like tiny press email. Purely because it&#8217;s quick, and I use that with that Twentig plugin. So basically it increases the capabilities, what you can do with it. And you basically run it like an Astra theme or like a Hello theme, but using the block editor. And that to me has actually been a really great quick process to be able to use and reiterate on these sites that, aren&#8217;t overly saturated with a lot of different, interesting CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I&#8217;m doing something that&#8217;s a more complicated design and we&#8217;re talking about a lot of things would be more like outside of a grid layout. If we&#8217;re offsetting things, stuff like that. I tend to go ahead and actually do kind of a more traditional theme around that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending really on who the end user is and who the who&#8217;s going to be kind of working on that. Usually I&#8217;ll go to Understrap theme or something like that, or the other one&#8217;s Picostrap, to use the bootstrap framework and do something more, more interesting from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a big proponent of bootstrap. The only reason I use it is because there&#8217;s so many developers that I can throw into something that&#8217;s been built with bootstrap, for CSS and JavaScript that know how to work with it. So that&#8217;s really the end reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting that even amongst people who&#8217;ve been using it for a large amount of time, as soon as the level of difficulty ramps up, the reliance on old trusted techniques still kicks back in doesn&#8217;t? We haven&#8217;t quite got across that bridge, but I feel that with WordPress six and maybe looking towards WordPress seven, which is still a long way off, I know, that we may be getting closer to the point where that decision is more and more straightforward to make.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:29] <strong>Daniel Schutzsmith:</strong> The larger thing for me is the reason that we can&#8217;t do more complex things inside the block editor really has to do with the version control. Because if I&#8217;m overriding CSS. If I do it in WordPress right now, I don&#8217;t have version control around the custom CSS I throw in. I can&#8217;t go back and see what I had done before. Whereas if I do that with code and I do that, putting it inside of Git version control, or something like that, I can you know, go back in time and get back to old stuff that we&#8217;ve done and see that progression. That&#8217;s another million dollar idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If someone builds in a better version control system into some of the coding aspects of what&#8217;s inside of WordPress, I think that would also get developers to really take off in there. I just think that the future of WordPress to me is, it&#8217;s looking very bright and I know sometimes we might feel a little grim, especially coming out of the pandemic and especially with so many things happening in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;m really hoping that what we see kind of in the next, few years here really just kind of changes the way that, we realized that we&#8217;re pressed as a very professional system and we&#8217;re just growing up. If we follow along and if we tread our own path, and I think we&#8217;re all gonna come out okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Daniel Schutz Smith. Thank you for joining us on the podcast today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:34] <strong>Daniel Schutzsmith:</strong> Yeah, thank you.</p>\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 13 Apr 2022 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"Post Status: This Week at WordPress.org (April 11, 2022)\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=95984\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://poststatus.com/this-week-at-wordpress-org-april-11-2022/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7224:\"<p>Each week we are highlighting the news from WordPress.org that you don\'t want to miss.
